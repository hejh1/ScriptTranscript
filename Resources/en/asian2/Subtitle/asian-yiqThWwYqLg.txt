Hi everyone, nice to meet you. My name is Wooyoung Lim. I am an associate professor of Economics and the UG-coordinator of two programs offered by the Department of Economics at HKUST: BBA in Economics and BSc in Economics and Finance. Let me spend about 20 minutes to introduce the two programs to you. I hope you enjoy it!

Our department offers three UG programs altogether: BBA in Economics, BSc in Mathematics and Economics, and BSc in Economics and Finance. The BSc in Math-Econ program is jointly offered with the Department of Mathematics. In this presentation, I will focus on the other two programs: BBA in Economics and BSc in Economics and Finance.

So, what is Economics? It is hard to define Economics in one or two sentences, but let me try. It is a social science that studies the choices that “we”—individuals, businesses, organizations, governments, and entire societies—make as they cope with the scarcity of resources. It also studies the incentives that influence and reconcile the choices we make. We all make choices every moment of our lives. Economics emphasizes the consequences of the choices we make. If we choose to produce one good or service, that means we cannot produce something else, due to the limited time and resources. If we decide to buy one product, that means we cannot buy something else. This basic "trade-off" results in the notion of opportunity cost. Economics presumes that people respond to the incentives provided by the opportunity costs of their choices. Any decision problems that involve trade-offs are economic decision problems. It covers a wide range of problems, from individual decision-making problems to public policy-making problems. Not only consumer consumption choice problems and producer profit maximization problems but also marriage and political voting decisions. More "macro-level" decision problems are covered as well, including the housing market, stock market, exchange rates, unemployment, international trade, and economic growth.

Economics consists of several key building blocks. Microeconomics is a field of economics that studies individual decision problems. The famous notion of the "invisible hand" by Adam Smith is one of the key concepts in Microeconomics. Macroeconomics is an area that studies more aggregate-level problems, including economic growth, interest rates, unemployment, asset market bubbles, monetary policy, and so on. Econometrics is a subject that investigates statistical methodologies used to deal with micro and macro level data. These three key fields of economics are tied together by the fundamental methodology of theoretical and model-based analysis. As a field of science, economists believe that all models have to be tested rigorously. That’s why the final missing building block is the empirical and data-driven analysis.

So, what is the main objective of our programs? Of course, we want to teach Economics well. But more importantly, we would like to help our students build an "analytical mindset." The analytical mindset will be extremely powerful when it comes with proper analytical skills to deal with data, given that we are now living in an era of big data. Our curriculum is designed for our students to obtain a balanced micro and macroeconomic point of view as well. Together with these, the quantitative analytical training that our programs offer will allow our students to identify and address novel and challenging problems successfully.

Then, you may wonder why you need to study Economics at HKUST. That’s why I now introduce you to the special and unique values that our university, school, and department can add for you. First, according to the QS World University Ranking in 2020, one of the most influential university ranking measures, the Department of Economics at HKUST is ranked 29th in the world, 1st in Hong Kong, 3rd in Greater China, and 5th in Asia. Of course, this ranking is a noisy measure, but it is definitely informative about the academic and educational quality that our department provides to our students.

Next, we offer very flexible, credit-based program curriculums, which consist of four different course categories: University common core courses, Business core courses, Major required courses, and additional free electives. The university common core courses cover various basic but fundamental courses across different disciplines. Business core courses are the core courses in business subjects, including economics, accounting, information systems, marketing, and management. Major required courses are the courses focusing on economics in topic and methodology. More advanced level economics courses belong to this category. And there are a few extra elective courses you can choose to take. BBA ECON and BSc ECOF are differentiated from each other with respect to the compositions of these requirements. 

First, BBA ECON requires 36 credits of common core courses, 45-46 credits of Business core courses, and 23-24 credits of major required courses. Second, BSc ECOF requires 36 credits of common core courses, 33-34 credits of Business core courses, and 40-41 credits of major required courses. Both programs have the minimum requirement of 120 credits. This simple comparison allows us to understand that the BBA ECON program is suitable for students with broad interests who would like to explore various kinds of business subjects, while BSc ECOF is suitable for those who would like to get more focused training on Economics and Finance. After all, the pros and cons of each program seem quite clear. BBA ECON provides you with larger flexibility to pursue double major, given the lower requirement for the major required courses. It focuses on applying economic knowledge and analysis to a wide range of business environments. At the same time, it provides our students with great exposure to the analytical framework that the field of economics emphasizes. Eventually, the training broadens your view of the world so that you should be able to successfully address any social and business problems. 

On the other hand, BSc ECOF offers more focused training on Economics and Finance. It aims at providing rigorous training and delivering fundamental knowledge. In the process of learning, you will encounter a number of instances in which you are asked to learn and use mathematical, statistical, and modeling tools. So, you should not be afraid of them. Eventually, the program will enhance your confidence in dealing with complex social and business problems based on theoretical and data analysis and identifying a causal relationship.

So, what do you need to choose between BBA ECON and BSc ECOF when you want to study Economics at HKUST? Your answer should depend on your interests and the career path that you would like to pursue. What kind of jobs do you expect to get after graduating from our programs? Here is a brief summary of the data from the 2019 graduate employment survey. As you can see here, quite a majority of students from both programs got a job in the banking and finance sector, followed by the administration and management sector. One key observation about the difference between the two programs is that the job placement of the BBA ECON students is more diverse, while that of the BSc ECOF students is more concentrated. But I would like to emphasize that over 60% of our students received two or more job offers when or before they graduated. 

Of course, the great success that our students achieved came from their original and raw talent. But we also do our best to help our students develop their full potential. For example, nearly 90% of our students have internship experiences. We organize alumni sharing sessions, career fairs, and industry talks regularly. We also provide several channels for our students to experience economic research. It includes junior research fellowships, independent research projects, and the undergraduate research opportunity (UROP) program. Through these channels, you will be able to interact with our faculty members and have an opportunity to be part of their research.

For those who are interested in pursuing further graduate studies, I would like to share with you some data about what programs our students pursue to study further after they graduate from our programs. As you can see in the table here, we continuously send our best students to the very top economics PhD programs in the US and UK. It is noticeable that some of our students pursue Marketing PhDs, which, in my view, is also a very smart choice for those who received rigorous economics and analytical training but are interested in more applied business subjects.

To summarize, we are doing our best to provide you with a good bridge to your brighter future. I would like to invite all of you to be part of the Department of Economics, School of Business and Management at HKUST in the near future. If you have any further inquiries, please do not hesitate to visit our departmental website or contact us at econ@ust.hk.

So, how was the tour we prepared for you of our two economics programs? I guess that you were able to get some basic knowledge about our program but may still want to know more about our department. If that is the case, I strongly encourage you to visit the department website and take a look at our faculty profiles. I am pretty sure that you will find they are doing very interesting research!
