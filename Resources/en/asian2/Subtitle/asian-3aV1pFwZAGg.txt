"Christopher, before we talk about, well, for good, I got to ask you about how you're assessing this banking crisis that we're seeing in Europe and the US right now. Do you see any kind of bigger fallout from Credit Suisse, and are there any kind of contingency measures in place similar to all of you?

We have been monitoring the situation closely, and back in Hong Kong, as you mentioned, our exposure to those isn't very limited in terms of those life examples. The market settles our banking system. They are very much robustly regulated. For example, if you look at the current capital adequacy ratio for our banks, it basically exceeds 20 percent, way above the national level. So all these things are a testimony to the robustness of financial regulation.

But of course, with all of these things, we are monitoring the situation like all of you. Because we've seen perhaps some anecdotal talk of there being flows of money into Hong Kong. What are you seeing in terms of that as this banking crisis continues to affect the global banking system in terms of money coming in and out of Hong Kong?

Generally speaking, if you look at the way that our capital markets, like the bank market, work, I think they have been slowly operating, and we see no issue so far. At the same time, I think back to the theme of today's interview, as you highlighted, basically it is about wealth. And that's exactly what we tried to do—strengthen and consolidate our role as an asset and wealth management center by attracting more family offices here.

Christopher, David here. So what is new about what the offering is right now? I'll ask him directly: what is Hong Kong offering that Singapore cannot? If you look at the overall landscape of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, I think it's estimated there are over 20,000 of them back in Hong Kong, which is the largest size among all global cities. But we want to do more and consolidate more. That's why, in the coming Friday, we are going to provide a policy statement in terms of a whole area of measures that we'll put forward to draw more family offices here, because we see a lot of synergies between what we do here and the needs of family offices.

Specifically, in terms of the policy statement, while I would not show all of the details because all the details will be announced on Friday, I think there are a few key things. Number one is that we will have a tax concession, which is a full tax concession for single family offices. The bar that we set right now is 30 million U.S. dollars, and for those family offices that will invest in Hong Kong for that amount, some additions will be given a full tax concession of 16.5 percent. That's number one.

And number two, in terms of what will be new, as highlighted in the budget earlier, we will relaunch a capital investment engine scheme, i.e., for people who are putting money in the local asset money market, excluding property. We allow them to come, reside, and develop here. For details, we are still working on those, and we will share more later on. But that said, I think these are the two things, among others, that will be showcased in the coming policy statement to be announced on Friday.

Well, so good summit, right? Christopher, I don't mean to steal thunder from Friday. You're saying that some of the good stuff for them, but since you mentioned something, I need to ask you then: the tax concession, that's one. Will you have a minimum amount that family offices will need to keep in Hong Kong as a way, I guess, to bolster the offering?

Yeah, I think similar to other schemes in the world, we do have a minimum. As I highlighted, it's 30 million U.S. dollars, and if you compare that amount with other schemes globally, I would say that's a fairly competitive level. I would say in terms of family office wealth, we talk about the next generation. Very often, I'm not just talking about financial returns; they're looking for socially responsible investments, like art, or charities. And that's why, when it comes to the well-for-good summit, it is actually a very broad range of subjects that we'll cover. 

And there will be, for one, tax; one is about Shery Ahn; one is about art; and one is about philanthropy. So the reason that we named this summit "Well, for Good" is that there are two reasons. Number one, "for good" in English means lasting. So if I may, it's different from other wealth management summits because it's meant to be lasting at the same time to be passed on from generation to another. That's why we put a wealth of good for that sense, and other meaningful wealth is that it means for good causes. As I highlighted, this generation really is looking for returns beyond financial returns; it could be social returns or more broadly, charities, whatever. And that's why we put this as the overall theme of the summit, and under this theme, the four topics I just highlighted.

Okay, Chris, I want to get a sense, though, of, you know, you're trying to attract family offices into Hong Kong, but Hong Kong is suffering from certain image problems, such as the encroachment on its legal system. For one thing, it's something which people really respected, but also that comes with the national security law and the territory's proximity to China here as well, and the vagueness of that national security law. How are you going to navigate that and make it a sell?

In fact, throughout the latter part of last year and the early part of this year, I've been going to different places across the world in terms of having meetings with business and also financial people. I think one message is very clear: Hong Kong's financial system and also financial center strength is evident. That's number one. And number two, in terms of the rule of law, the issue just mentioned, I think Hong Kong is one of the few jurisdictions in Asia where you can still sue the government and win. It was the case before, and it is the case now. 

And number three, in terms of the security issue, I think we are not dissimilar from other jurisdictions where they also have similar provisions in protecting national security. So on that account, I think national security actually provides a stability that we require to further our development. You also mentioned the possibility to me that I would say that this is an advantage because, after all, if we look at all the connected grants, for example, in the capital markets that we have built—Bond, Equity, ETF, be it like one connect and now the swap connects and serial going on there and wealth management connect—I think all of these collective themes are playing to our advantage. 

And the "one country, two systems" principle is down in Hong Kong. So we could even tell."
