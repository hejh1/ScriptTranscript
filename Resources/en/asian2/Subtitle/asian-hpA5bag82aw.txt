In this video, I'm going to be sharing with you the Deloitte interview process step by step. So if you're interviewing with Deloitte or just curious about what the Deloitte interview process is like, this video is for you. And of course, if you like this video, don't forget to hit the like button. Alright, let's dive in!

If you're watching this video, you probably already know the benefits of working at a place like Deloitte and how amazing that opportunity can be. In fact, you don't have to look very far. I remember when I was recruiting for Deloitte and thinking to myself, "Wow, if this is how they treat candidates, I wonder how they treat their actual employees." I was attending an info session with Deloitte, and all around the room, you could see employees of Deloitte and how happy they were to share their stories and try to recruit the next group of people to work at Deloitte. Not only that, but just the fact that when you go through the interview process, they were willing to fly me out halfway across the country. They hadn't even considered if I was going to be a great consultant yet, but they were willing to pay for my plane ticket, my hotel, my food, and my taxis just for the chance to interview at their office. All of that as a candidate! So I imagine what it is like to actually work there.

Of course, when you work there, you realize there's a lot of benefits to working at Deloitte. The first is all the exposure you get and all the skills you're going to build. Deloitte actually makes more revenue than McKinsey, Bain, and BCG all combined. As a result, you get exposure to a lot of different clients and a lot of different projects during your time at Deloitte. Second, Deloitte is among the top five percent of companies in terms of pay and compensation. Can you imagine being a 21-year-old and automatically earning in the top five percent of earners worldwide? That's amazing! And third, whether you work at Deloitte for one year or a lifetime, you're always going to have that brand recognition on your resume. Deloitte has offices in 150 countries—that's two and a half times more than McKinsey, three times more than BCG, and almost four times more than Bain. That's amazing, the type of recognition you get even after you decide to leave Deloitte.

So, there are a lot of benefits to working at Deloitte. But before you can work at Deloitte and get these benefits, you actually have to get a job offer. So let's go into what it actually takes to get a job offer at Deloitte. The good news is that when it comes to the Deloitte interview process, it's pretty simple. There are only four steps: you have to apply, pass the online assessment, pass the first-round interviews, and pass the final round of interviews. 

Let's talk about what each of these entails. The first step is you have to apply to Deloitte. Luckily, Deloitte makes this really easy. As a student, you just have to upload your resume and your transcript, and either apply through your career center or through an online portal at Deloitte. If you're an experienced hire—that is, someone already working and not in school—it's also easy. All you have to do is upload your resume to the online portal. Very simple! When Deloitte is actively hiring, you can expect a response back in roughly 7 to 14 days. Sometimes it might be less, and sometimes it might take a little bit longer, but on average, you can expect one to two weeks.

After you get the application in, let's head to the Deloitte recruiters. If they actually want to interview you, they might decide to move you to the second stage, which is the online assessment. The Deloitte online assessment is Deloitte's way of evaluating if you could be a great consultant. They will give you a test to see how well you can use your numerical reasoning as well as how well you exercise judgment. For example, you might get 35 questions covering five different topics, and they want to see how well you navigate through it. But don't worry! If tests or online assessments worry you, I have a video where I go deep into detail about how to prepare for those. I'll link that below in the description. So if you have that, you can rest easy.

Now, let's say that you pass the online assessment, or maybe the recruiter decides you didn't need to take it and just passes you right through to the interview. Then you go to the third step, which is the first round of interviews. The first round interviews are made up of two types of interviews: case interviews and behavioral interviews. 

Case interviews are when you're given a business prompt and asked to solve it. The type of prompt you'll be asked to solve will depend on the branch or team that you're applying to at Deloitte. For example, if you're applying to Deloitte Consulting, which is made up of three prominent branches, and you're applying to strategy and operations, which deals with high-level business issues, your case problems will involve the type of work that the team does. You might be given a case on how to optimize pricing all the way to how to optimize the supply chain. If you're applying to the technology branch of Deloitte, then you might get a problem that involves technology transformation, such as a digital strategy or how to incorporate a certain technology into the client's ongoing process. 

The third prominent branch is human capital, which deals with people and processes. You might be given a case, for example, on how to reorganize a team or how to improve knowledge management for a certain division of a company. What you want to do here is make sure that you're preparing for the right team in the right branch. If you're applying for human capital, you can definitely expect to have more human capital-related cases. Regardless of the team you apply to, Deloitte actually looks for four things: they want to know if you are a structured problem solver, if you can think analytically, if you are able to balance creativity and practicality, and finally, do you have resilience? That is, if you encounter a problem, are you going to look proactively for a solution, or do you just quit? This is important for all employees of Deloitte.

The second part of it is the behavioral interview. This is when interviewers focus on two things. The first question interviewers will care about is whether you actually fit the firm culture. They want to know that you've done your research and thought about why you're interviewing today. For example, if you're applying to Deloitte Consulting, they might ask, "Why are you applying to consulting?" and second, "Why Deloitte in particular?" The other half of it is they want to see how you deal with certain situations, so they're going to dig into your personal experience. For example, they might ask, "Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a manager. How did you handle that?"

By the way, if you're preparing for interviews at Deloitte or wondering how to get an interview at Deloitte, I'd love to help you. I'm going to provide a link below where you can actually book a free strategy session with my team. I'm going to walk you through step by step how you can land your offer at Deloitte and other firms as well.

Finally, the fourth step in the Deloitte process is the final round interviews. Though it's called the final round interviews, this might be a combination of two rounds of interviews or just one final round of interviews. Just keep that in mind. What I'm bucketing as the final round is that you've already made it past the first round, and depending on the role and the team you applied to, you can expect either more case interviews or more behavioral interviews. In addition, you might either get a callback, or potentially, you might be asked to join what's called a group interview, where there will be multiple people in the room because the interviewers want to observe how you interact with others. 

So again, the final round interviews will vary depending on the team and the branch you're going after. You can usually expect to hear one of three outcomes within a week. Outcome number one is a "no," unfortunately. Outcome number two is that they're not quite sure yet and want to bring you back for an additional interview to gather more data points on you. Or outcome number three is that they extend you a contract and are excited to have you join the team. 

Now that you know how the Deloitte interview process works, I want to leave you with one strategy. This strategy is going to help you exponentially get closer to getting your offer. The strategy is this: when you're applying to Deloitte, you want to be careful about which team and which branch you apply to because depending on the team or branch you apply to, you want to use that knowledge to your advantage. I see so many candidates who apply to Deloitte thinking that it doesn't matter which team or branch they apply to, and then they end up getting rejected. But if you do know which branch you're going to apply to, I want to share with you a methodology on how you can use that information to your advantage. 

Before we leave, I have two more things to help you. The first thing is if you are recruiting for Deloitte, if you put the word "Deloitte" in the comments below, I'm going to share additional resources to help you along the way. All you have to do is just hit "Deloitte" in the comment section below. 

The second thing is that if you're 100% serious about wanting to work at Deloitte or another amazing consulting firm, I want to be able to help you get there. Here at my consulting offer, my team of former recruiters, interviewers, and consultants, all we do is help people become management consultants. In fact, we've helped over 700 people land their dream job in management consulting, and our success rate is 89.6%. That means that 9 out of 10 people who work with us land at least one consulting offer. But don’t just take my word for it—hear from Ella, who actually had less than three weeks to prepare for her interviews with Deloitte and how she was able to navigate that process and land her dream offer at Deloitte. I'll share that video somewhere above my head. 

Alright, I'll see you in the next video!
