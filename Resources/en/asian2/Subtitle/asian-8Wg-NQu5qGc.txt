"Big outflows from CPF OA in 2025. Now, I'm actually thinking out loud, and this is not confirmed yet. In 2025, there will be outflows. This, again, is not financial advice; I'm just providing this to leadership, and I'm actually sharing with you my thoughts FOC. I'm going to speak from the heart. Just in case you didn't know, recent news from 2015 onwards is that the CPF special account will be closed. Once you reach the age of 55, you may still be employed after the age of 55, and this definitely impacts you. So, not only does it impact you, it impacts everybody who's already above the age of 55. They will see their special accounts closed, and all monies from there will be moved to the ordinary account. Anyone from 2025 onwards above the age of 55 will only have three accounts: the ordinary account earning 2.5%, the retirement account, and the Medisave account. As mentioned in the previous video, the retirement account fits into CPF Life, whereby you have no flexibility. You pump the monies in; it's good, but that one pays you monthly amounts, and the monies are locked up there, so you have to be on good terms with that.

In this previous sharing, I've also mentioned that CPF shielding is gone already. You can check the links above. From that video, I actually like this comment a lot: Josh, I know that you're trying to be neutral and you don't add fire to oil, but I fail to see how anyone in Singapore benefits from the abolishment of SA post age 55. Someone with $10,000, some with $100,000, or $1 million in SA—they all don't benefit, which is something that I agree with and something you should be aware of. Also, nobody benefits from this because we are end users, and we're actually seeing an interest rate cut. The government benefits because the interest they pay out is less—2.5% versus 4.08%. But again, this whole discussion is not about politics. We also often forget that government officials also have CPF, so they are also taking a cut. The government's role is actually to allocate resources across society. Sometimes we win, and sometimes we lose, so let's not dwell too much on political speculation and stuff.

Some people actually mistake this closing of the special account as a punishment for shielding, which I also agree is pretty nonsensical. If the government wanted to stop CPF shielding, they could simply allow MVE out of SA, which is also mentioned in this comment. So again, everybody has a special account after age 55, especially if you're continuously working, and we all are actually seeing this cut in terms of interest rates. So, in terms of feeling sorry, let's keep it as there and move on to today's entire title: Why exactly do I foresee big outflows from CPF OA for anyone above the age of 55? 

Now, if you're financially savvy, in today's environment, 2.5% guaranteed is peanuts. Correct? But don't get me wrong—back in 2019, for example, 2.5% was a godsend, government guaranteed. Back then, Fed rates were around 1%, and in the future, maybe if Fed rates start to drop again and global interest plunges back down to 0-1%, then all this discussion is moot. But in today's world, we are in a high interest environment, correct? And we are very likely to stay there for a long while. So, as end users, we are faced with this dilemma: 2.5% guaranteed in CPF OA, or should we move the monies out to find better interest? 

Let me ask you this question: When GX Bank created a high-interest account and then cut their offering, what happened? People moved their money from the account, correct? Savvy people are always looking out for better options, and the government's 2.5% in CPF OA now really doesn't make the cut. Because, quite simply, if you want to stay with government-backed interest rates, what about Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB)? Why not? If you are above the age of 55 and you only have monies in your OA with 2.5%, why not draw it out and pump it into Singapore Savings Bonds? It's liquid, correct? It's government-backed, correct? You can still take it out almost any time, correct? Why in the world would you keep 2.5% in OA then choose against this?

Yes, Singapore Savings Bonds have a cap of $200,000. It's DIY also, so you need to go online and buy. That's why I also understand that most people are lazy. Just an extra 2.5%: move here, move there. Some who are savvy will do it; some who are just lazy, which I think most people are, will just not bother. That's why I believe Singapore Savings Bonds is not likely going to be the biggest beneficiary of this whole entire change. Who would it be? You can take a guess. Let me share with you: it's none other than banks, correct? 

Let me show you some offers to tempt you if you're above the age of 55. Let's simulate next year; have some mental fun with it. Let me show you this by OCBC Premier Banking. Look at this: If you park your monies with us, we give you a base interest of 1.05%, and then if you don't make withdrawals and you continuously add in according to terms and conditions, $2,000 per month, we will give you 3.7% interest. 3.7% interest—more than 2.5% interest, correct? What would the pitch be? “Hey, Ms. or Mr., pump in big amounts here, and then every month use $2,000 from your CPF OA. You draw out and you pump back in. You meet the terms and conditions, and you earn 3.7%.” And not just that; every time you come to our branch, I'll give you free coffee, and I'll give you priority. Withdraw from us—cannot close, man. I bet bankers would be selling this left, right, and center, correct?

What about Citibank? No, I'm not representing any bank; I'm just pulling up some examples that I hear from private clients because I don't park monies in banks. Bankers don't call me; I learned this from private clients that I work with. How about this by Citibank? “Hey, Mr. or Ms., you pump your money; they save out in CPF OA. You pump it in. I designed a strategy for you: you pump in $250,000 fresh funds today, and you will get an $880 reward. There are some other FRS which I also don't understand—$880 from us, just for trusting our bank. Fantastic, correct? And I'll teach you: if you spend and earn 1.5%, you get it. Save and earn—just move $3,000 per month again from your CPF OA. We will design a strategy: okay, draw, pump in, draw, pump in. You meet the terms and conditions; total account interest rates 3%, without doing any other things such as borrowing from us and investing with us if you don't like. So easy to sell, correct?

You see what will happen: banks will suck out a lot of CPF OA funds simply by thinking of a creative and good pitch that actually benefits the customer. So it's not like there's something wrong with it; it's just a superior alternative, and banks will be the ones proactively pushing for this change, in my opinion. When I foresee what's going to happen in 2025, again, that's not financial advice; nothing is confirmed. But again, you see that there's a lot of logic. Your next question may be, “Hey Josh, I don't have so much CPF OA. Bankers won't call me like you.” But hey, some of them will still call the retail side, correct? 

Let me show you some potential offers from fixed deposits. “Hey, Mr. or Ms. So-and-so, why not draw your CPF OA after age 55? You park it with us; I'll give you free...” You see, over here many banks can provide 3.5%, 3.35%. So many different kinds of offers that you can get rather than idling your money in a 2.5% CPF OA. Why would anyone in the right frame of mind continue to keep 2.5% once they reach this point? Call from a banker? Agree? Smash the like button, as always, because I'm sharing this thought leadership with you early so that you are well-prepared when the time comes in 2025. 

And just in case you are young and you're not going to reach there soon, you have parents, you have uncles, aunties—they are going to receive these pitches or face this dilemma. So do share this video with them. And as always, smash or subscribe if you like quality content like this that helps you understand finance a lot better. I also show you different things that I would do as a creator. Why not do a content piece that fixes the ladder? If you have CPF OA after the age of 55, you can buy a lot of fixed deposits here and there. Buy this, buy that; build a ladder that can get you different maturity periods, and all getting above 2.5%—very easy to do, correct? 

So the conclusion, again, is quite simple: bye-bye to CPF OA once you're above the age of 55, and it backs my personal opinion that there will likely be outflows. I come from the financial services industry; I would like to urge insurers to get their teams to work a lot harder. Insurance, if you can build a product next year in 2025 suited for those above the age of 55 and you can get me 2.5% guaranteed, with some upside also from non-guaranteed returns because you have equity allocations in PA, once you have bond rates going up, there's a lot of reasons to get a better offer. I can guarantee you, you can come up with such a plan, and I can sell millions for you because, again, it's superior—it's a no-brainer. I'm helping people get more returns. 

So do something—create par plans, savings plans, annuity plans, retirement plans. The market potential is just enormous because the benchmark now is not very high. Also, do add flexibility. Before I forget to mention, insurance plans nowadays are very dated; they don't have a lot of flexibility in terms of withdrawal options and interest. If you don't input enough flexibility into your withdrawal, my selling pitch should be, again, CPF Life, which is coming from the retirement account, and that one doesn't have flexibility but gives 4.08%. So that is a hurdle to cross. There needs to be flexibility. But also to mention, when you park money in RA, the amounts you can't see really are going to be monthly cash flow; you can't surrender out. So get an insurance plan you can surrender out with a certain residual value. 

So I would like to suggest this: if I can create an ideal product right now—I don't have the critical mass, maybe one day in the future I could—I would design something like this: hey, a 2.6% guaranteed interest. Don't be 25; do 2.6% because just in case some customers have HDB mortgage loans to pay off at 2.6%. I like to create a product that is 2.6% guaranteed and a little bit of just non-guaranteed upside—good, right? Better already! And everything else is just upside. Third option for regular payout, just in case someone wants a flexible income stream. Have that flexibility designed into that insurance plan. Fourth, of course, have flexibility in withdrawal. Once someone locks up for five years, they can fully withdraw or can take out 50% at any time. These are certain good considerations to design a product that is way superior and can help a Singaporean move their CPF OA monies out after the age of 55 and get higher returns outside.

Hopefully, all this makes sense. And I like to end things by answering this question: “Hey Josh, everything makes sense, but why aren't people doing it right now?” Let me answer that also. In the current situation with OA and SA, I don't know if you know this, but if you are above the age of 55 and you want to withdraw money out, you have to take it out from SA first. SA gives you 4.08%. Taking it out is painful—the hurdle rate is high. You're not going to find fixed deposits at 4.08%. That's why for anyone with shielding done properly, they would be thinking, “It's no point moving my SA out just to access my OA,” or much rather buy OA fixed deposits or invest into TBS. That's why the situation is still a bit different. 

But now, the new rule is from 2025 onwards, as everything will be merged into OA for some above the age of 55. By then, the opportunity cost is just 2.5%. No 4.08% barrier to block the decision-making—just 2.5%. The stay or do you want to leave? The answer is pretty clear, and that's why today's title. As always, if you enjoyed this, smash the like button, and check out this first episode I've done on why CPF shielding is dead already. If you haven't seen that, check out this previous video.
