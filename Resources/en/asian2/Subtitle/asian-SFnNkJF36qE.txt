Shortly after the Fed cut rates, China introduced its most aggressive stimulus on 25th September 2024. I don't know when you'll be viewing this, so for me, it's actually important what's happening there because I do have a stake in the game. I have portfolios exposed to China as well as Hong Kong. I'll share with you more in detail, so do stay right to the very end. 

Now, this recovery has been massive; the pace is crazy. As you can see over here, popular tech-focused China ETFs like KWEB are up 51% in a month, CQQQ is up 53% in a month, and HENG is up 30%. After this rally, an expected 10 to 12% correction is anticipated, depending on when you measure it. So when this crazy rally faded, I was very intrigued. I wanted to research a bit first before sharing with you what exactly are possible action steps you can take to participate, or at least to benefit, maybe from this potential change in China as well as Hong Kong stocks.

So let's take a look at the stimulus package. As mentioned over here, there are three parts to it. The first is that this is by PBOC (People's Bank of China), which is their central bank. The first part is a cut on their Reserve Requirement Ratios (RRR) by half a percentage point, and a reduction in the main policy interest by 0.2 percentage points. Both of these are larger than usual. PBOC has also indicated additional cuts are possible by year-end. Very similar to the Fed, I guess PBOC will also reduce at that pace or more aggressively.

Second, PBOC will cut mortgage rates for existing home loans by roughly half a percentage point nationwide. This is to support the residential property market. And the third is that PBOC will actually be creating a pair of new structural monetary policy tools to support the stock market. The key phrase here is "support the stock market." Eligible institutional investors will be able to borrow liquid assets such as treasury bonds and central bank bills directly from the central bank using assets like ETFs as collateral, and then sell them to get the cash they need to invest more into equity markets. That in effect is just leverage—I'm going to lend you money to leverage. The central bank will provide refinancing loans for banks extending credit to publicly traded companies aiming to buy back their own shares. Wow! So this is just telling you that the central bank says, "Go and buy your own shares, don't worry, I'll lend you the money." 

That is why some hedge fund managers read this as a ridiculous government initiative; it's extremely, extremely powerful. Listen to this: believe it or not, swap facilities to buy stocks are encouraging buybacks—encouraging buybacks of stocks. Okay, this is China; stock buybacks are not only encouraged, but they are also lending you money. 

Back to these three points on this stimulus, I reflected on what this means for us international investors. I think it's not the biggest impact. The green one—where they are going to lend money to buy securities—is a direct prop-up of stock market prices. 

Let me share with you my interpretation of the situation. The first is that this rally is fed by short sellers covering. As mentioned over here, short sellers are feeding the heat from the China Fed rally. These smart guys have lost more than $8 billion. Ready again for short selling? Your downside is unlimited because you have to buy back in the future, correct? If the stock price triples, your $1 of initial capital could lose $4. Even so, that's why short squeeze rallies are dead violent. 

Now it's easy to confirm whether they are short sellers or not. And before I get there, help me smash the subscribe button, especially if you learned something today and you want to keep tabs on the developments of Chinese equity and Hong Kong equity. I will be covering them on this very channel, so stay tuned for it. 

Let me next pull up the YANG ETF, which is actually the Direxion Daily FTSE China Bear 3X ETF. This YANG ETF has seen a three-year net inflow of $50.7 million. As we can see, there was a big spike in August and September. A lot of short sellers got their timing absolutely wrong. This has been further verified with other information, such as this, which is short interest on one of the bigger China ETFs. 2024 is an all-time high for short seller interest. 

So again, the first leg up is short sellers internationally stampeding over each other to hit for the exit. Let’s take a look at the run-up: one month, it's 30%. What about popular individual stocks that are shorted internationally? Let's put out the five biggest: Tencent, Baidu, JD, and Meituan. You'll see Tencent has relatively underperformed all of them at 28%, Baidu at 36%, but Alibaba is at 45%. JD and Meituan are both up 80% over the last month.

Let's get back to our discussion about this market rally. Prior to this recent rally, short sellers were profitably building their positions in a falling market. Since the rebound, however, short selling in the group has slowed; they're getting scared. Before that, it was just double down, double down, double down—typical loss-making trader mindset. 

Before paging, surprise the market with its stimulus plans. Shorting China stocks has been popular with a number of market observers underweighting the sector. It is true that recently there have been a lot of Emerging Markets ex-China funds. Previously, China has been a key component of Emerging Markets, so underweighting the sector means that some are labeling the country uninvestable. Now you may have heard that yourself. This has been fear-mongering going on for a very long time. 

As mentioned in the survey, 9% of correspondents say that shorting Chinese equities was the most crowded trade, second only to going long on the Magnificent 7 stocks. So you see where the fear is: the fear has become shorting China and longing the Magnificent 7. The most painful trades for short sellers have been Alibaba and JD. On the flip side, traders betting against NIO, Li Auto, and PDD are still in the black. PDD has shot up through the roof, and even with the recent rally, short sellers aren't rushing to cover their positions just yet. That is actually why there could be a second wave of short seller panic; I'll touch on that in a while. 

Alibaba's stock price might see the greatest impact if shorts begin covering in size, as the stock has seen increased short selling into this rally. Now, let me touch back on the point of some short sellers not rushing to cover their positions. Some of them may have survived the May 2024 rally of 20% that HENG, for example, exhibited. This time around, they feel that they can just hold on and let things subside. But maybe this time around it's different. What if more and more people jump on the bandwagon and say, "Don't fight PBOC"? 

What if more and more big hedge fund managers are waiting for the dip to help push the index up because they know short sellers have been squeezed? Let's pull back on the chart. Once it gets past more than 50%, it may become unbearable, and short sellers might just panic yet again. That is why there's every possibility that this could be an extremely volatile period for retail traders. 

This leads to the second point, which is that the majority of China retail investors, in my opinion, are not even in yet. The headline reads: "China Investors Rush into Stocks for Fear of Missing Out on Epic Rally." Brokerages are bustling with business, and there's an explosion in stock turnover. Some who are interviewed by the press have mentioned that they are starting to buy stocks using borrowed money. There's no other way to get rich other than doubling down on stocks—don’t do that! The market crash, as you can see, this time could be unprecedented. 

Now this comment seems crazy and euphoric, but not again—this is on the 30th of September; it's just two weeks into the rally. How much craziness can there be built in? You know, euphoria in stock markets needs years to build. Two weeks? We can guess that there's only early adopters, which means if we draw this chart out, you would realize that 70%—who are the majority—have not even taken action, have not even been persuaded to overcome their own biases. 

So that's why euphoria needs years to build in the market, and this has really happened before. Let's look back in time: previous index rises have been at least 50% and for more than a year. If I were someone new who doesn't have China exposure, I would buy systematically. I think that is a good tactical approach. This is actually shared with a former member in my Telegram group who has done very well and been very patient. You would see over here he's invested since September 2021, correct? And consistently dollar-cost averaged all the way. As of today, right now, that portfolio sits in the green, and I would estimate that as of this time of filming, he's probably up 13 or 14% already. 

It's super volatile, but generally still on the uptrend; dollar-cost averaging still works. Yes, on the uptrend it might benefit more, but again, this is a very volatile period for China and Hong Kong stocks. I think a long-term investment might be very emotional, as always. If you would like to join my Telegram group, I'll leave links below. 

Now since you stuck with me right to the very end, let me share with you a bonus on what I observe, which is why I'm optimistic. If you look at the heat map for China stocks, large state-owned banks are doing very well. This heat map, again, is from our sponsor today, Moomoo. You'll see that this sector has even recovered from this pullback, and on a longer time frame, they are actually confirmed on a bull up for Asian markets like Singapore. You would realize that banks typically lead a bull cycle, then the rest of the market catches up. 

If the economy can make it, you would guess that banks will be doing well already. Now if we check in terms of the Hong Kong side, banks are also leading the way. Besides banks, digital solution services—where Tencent sits—are also looking strong. Now, Tencent is a company I feel has strong fundamentals, and it's something that I've covered before in a previous video, "Stocks That I'm Secretly Buying." Check out this previous episode I have with that, and see you there. Take care, as always. Goodbye!
