Christopher, before we talk about wealth for good, I got to ask you about how you're assessing this banking crisis that we're seeing in Europe and the U.S. here right now. Do you see any kind of bigger fallout from Credit Suisse and are any kind of contingency measures in place? I think it's similar to all of you. We have been monitoring the situation closely. And back in Hong Kong, talk about CS or other instance you mentioned, our exposure to those is in suffer-limited in terms of both life, society, and the world.
our cut to markets and also our banking system, they are very much robustly regulated. Like for example, if you look at the current capital as with the racial of our banks, basically it's well exceeded 20% way above the international level of 8%. So all these, the thing is something that is testimony to the robustness of financial regulation. But of course, with all these things developing, we are monitoring situation like all of you.
We've seen perhaps a manate total talk of their being flows of money into Hong Kong. What are you seeing in terms of that as this banking crisis continues to affect the global banking system in terms of money coming in and out of Hong Kong? Jerry speaking, if you look at the way that our capital markets, like the bank market works, I think they have been smoothly operating and we see no issues so far. far. At the same time, I think back to the theme of today's interview as you highlight
basically is about wealth or good. And that's exactly what we try to do, try to strengthen and also consolidate our role as a set of wealth management center by drawing more family offices here. Christopher David here. So what is new about what the offering is right now? And I'll ask you directly, what is Hong Kong offering that Singapore cannot? Hmm. If you look at the overall landscape or landscape of ultra-high network individuals.
I think it's estimated over 20,000 of them are right here in Hong Kong, which is the largest size among all global cities. But we want to do more and consolidate more. And that's why, in a coming Friday, we are going to provide a policy statement in terms of a whole area of measures that will put forward to draw more family of his hair, because we see lots of synergies between what we do here and the needs of family of his. And specifically in terms of the policy statement, while I will not show all of the details
all the details will be announced this Friday. I think there are few, few key things. Number one is that we will have a text concession, which is a full text concession for single family officers. And the bar that we set right now is 30 million US dollars. And for those single family officers who invest in Hong Kong for that amount, subject to certain editions, they will be given a full text concession of 16.5% that's number one. And number two, in terms of what will be new
We will relaunch a capital investment engine scheme, i.e. for people who are putting money in the local asset market, excluding property, we allow them to come, reside and develop here. And for the details, we are still working on those and we will share more later on. But that said, I think these are the two things, among others, that will be showcased in the coming policy statement to be announced in the coming Friday, well for good summit. Right. Christopher, I don't mean to steal thunder from
because I know you're saving some of the good stuff for you then. But since you mentioned something, I need to ask you then. The tax concession, that's one. Will you have a minimum amount that family offices will need to keep in Hong Kong as a way, I guess, to bolster the offering? >> Yeah, I think similar to other schemes in the world, we do have a minimum as I high-eited. It's a $30 million US dollar.
the amount with other schemes globally, I would say there's a fairly competitive level. And then said I would say in terms of family office wealth, which talk about the next generation, the firm often are not just talking about financial returns, they are looking for going broadly like impact investments, like art, like charities. And that's why, for the coming well for good summits, it is actually a very broad range of subjects that we'll cover. and during before one is 10.
One is about green, one is about ad, and one is about philanthropy. So the reason that we named this summit well for good, there are two reasons. Number one, for good, as all of you know, in English means lasting. So for family wealth, different from other wealth, basically it's meant to be last, at the same time to be passed on from generation to another. That's why we put in well for good for their sense. And then other meaning for well for good is that it means for good causes. It's highlighted instead. How are you?
And now the next generation really are looking for returns beyond financial returns. It could be social returns or more broadly charities, whatever. And that's why we put this as the overall theme of the summit and have under this theme the four topics are just highlighted. Okay, Chris. I want to get a sense though of you know, you're trying to attract family offices into Hong Kong. But Hong Kong is suffering from certain image problems such as the encroachment on its legal system for one thing.
It's something which people really, really respected. But also, that comes with the national security law and the territory's proximity with China here as well. And the vagueness of that national security law. How are you going to navigate that and make it a cell? In fact, throughout the letterpal of last year, at early part of this year, I've been going to different places across the world in terms of having meetings with business and also financial people. I think one message is very clear that Hong Kong's
and also financial census strings are very obvious. That's number one. And number two, in terms of the rule of law issue, just mentioned, I think Hong Kong is one of the future restrictions in Asia, where you can still sue the government and still win. And this very much at the core of our rule of law, it was the case before and it's due to case now. And number three, in terms of the natural security issue, I think we are no dissimilar from all the jurisdictions, where they also have similar provisions in terms of protecting national security. So on that I found,
security, he actually provides the stability that we require to further our development. And you also mentioned about the proximity to the main line. I would say that that's our advantage. Because after all, if we look at all the connect programs, for example, in the capital markets that we have, billet bond, billet equity, billet ETFs, billet bond connect, and now the swap connect and going on the enhancement to wealth management connect. I think all these connectivities are playing to advantage at the one country to systems. I did it. Thank you.
