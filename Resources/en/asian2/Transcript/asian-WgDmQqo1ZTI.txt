I've enjoyed my time at USD and I believe you would feel the same if you come. First, let me share a bit about our graduate placement which may be a concern to prospective students and your parents. We are pleased to see that our graduates are well received by Tau Nouch corporates and Akraimi Inu.
institutions. Most of our graduates took the employment path, while the remaining decided to pursue further studies in Hong Kong or overseas. The majority of our graduates secured their job offers before graduation and had multiple offers in hand. Our recent graduates have been hired by top-notch corporates as shown on this slide. In these unusual years our graduates reached
made us incredibly proud. The three biggest sectors our graduates started their career in are banking and finance, administration and management and accounting or auditing and then others join various industries such as marketing and technology, so on and so forth. Now let's take a look at the other path. A small portion of our graduates spend the coming
doing postgraduate study in different disciplines, including business, social science, law, etc., in top universities around the globe. Where America and Europe remain as most popular destinations, we see an increasing number of students decided to stay in Asia for career preparation. One of the reasons for graduates being popular in academia is the reputation of our business
and the school. All business faculty obtained their PhDs in world-renowned universities. Our relentless global talent acquisition has brought more than 150 faculties from over 25 nationalities to business school. Around one-third of them are from the US, Canada or Europe, and most of them study in multiple countries. their high quality research.
output, not only benefits students learning, but also makes the school consistently ranked top across business areas. Combining the high reputation of the university and our graduates' employability, all these help build a worldwide academic and professional network for undergraduates. Let me just give you some examples. We have a joint degree program with the University of Southern California.
and Bacani University in Italy. WBB is a unique three-degree undergraduate program called WERB Bachelor in Business. WBB students will spend their first year at USC, second year at HKUST, and third year at Bacani. And in the final year, they can choose to go to any one of the three universities. After they graduate,
students get undergraduate degree from all three universities. The Business School has a robust, exchange network and strives to expand it to benefit our students' learning. Right now, we have close to 140 partners around the world. We have more than 50 partners in North America, more than 50 in Europe, and some of the best schools in Asia and Oceania. These are some photos shared.
by our students where they were on exchange. You can see that not only do they study and get to learn in some of the very best schools from around the world, they also really have the chance to submerge in different cultural experiences, visits, and make friends with people around the world. Each year, we send about 400 of our own students and receive 400 exchange in students, which
accounts for about 50% of our undergraduate students. Additionally, around 30% of the students join other study abroad programs, such as visiting programs and summer programs. Overall, 80% of business students get a chance to study abroad to enrich their learning experiences. As a young business school that has done so well within a short time, we cannot do it.
it on our own. We have money partnership with a wide range of corporations. These are just some examples of the partnerships where we organize competitions and projects. We have guest speakers who come into the classroom to enrich the learning experiences. We have a lot of different collaborations with industry leaders and organize events with different things. Since 2008 we have partnered
with leading organizations in various fields to offer corporate projects to business school students, to gain valuable learning experience and build a network by working as consultants. Here are some of our partners in recent years. We strive to build collaborations with corporates in traditional and up-and-coming industries, as students will only learn the most by applying knowledge in the real world.
The vast majority of our students in each program complete internships and gain valuable experience before they graduate. It is very common for business students to complete multiple full-time internships to build a professional network and discover their career interests. In fact, a significant portion of our graduates completed two or more full-time internships. apart from expansion.
corporate partnerships. Our own dedicated career service team provides professional one-on-one career consultation for students. Every year over 80 industry talks and dialogues with executives are organized for students. We also have alumni sharing and networking events. Our experience alumni are invited to be mentors of our students for a whole year.
In some, business school students get first-hand career information and real-world knowledge. Beyond internships, a wide array of co-curricular activities ranging from community services, culture events, sports, to business enrichment activities such as business case competitions and startup support are offered for students to lead a fruitful
University Life. Business students are empowered to customize their learning experience in four years due to the student center and highly flexible curriculum. In the next few minutes I will share the most recent updates to our business programs and admission details. We prioritize students' needs when we design the curriculum. Our undergraduate curriculum is a credit-based one.
means that students have the maximum autonomy to decide a credit load of each term. Synergizing the strengths of other HKUSD academic units, four science degree programs are offered to students who wish to pursue cross-disciplinary knowledge. The latest addition is the Bachelor of Science in Sustainable and Green Finance. jointly offer with the division of Imbara
and sustainability. Two kinds of degrees and 10 programs are solely offered by the Business School. Most of the students pursue a BBA degree, Bachelor of Business Administration. We also offer a couple of Bachelor of Science degrees that are more quantitative in nature. We have very comprehensive programs covering all the key business areas.
When students join the business school, they will study university common core courses and spend the first three semesters on business core courses. Business core courses ensure students have a broad, yet solid foundation across business area. Students will specialize in their selective business area from the fourth term, year two spring, onward. They may also want to use the
remaining of 120 credits to declare an additional major or minor in non-business areas. As a four-runner in business education, we spare no efforts in introducing new elements that accommodate students' interests to our curriculum. For example, the extended major approach is introduced. Students With a confirmed first business major may apply.

Students completing the extended measure will graduate with a title bearing both the selected traditional business major and the extended major. The two graphs at the bottom may give some insights into the synergy between
business and the two extended majors. I hope by now you have some ideas about our undergraduate education. Let me walk you through the emissions. HKUST Business School is a very international and multi-cultural school. This is where I get to know many faculty and other students from around the world as a We publicly found the university, the majority of our intake.

means you can take your time to find out where you are interested in before you decided to choose a particular major. On the other hand, for students who already know their interest, for example, are very interested in accounting, they could apply to our specific major directly. Some students are a bit concerned that if I choose the school-based admission route, that's that mean it would take longer time to complete the program.
and the answer is no. What happened is that students who come in, whether through the school base or program-based route, follow the exact same business foundational curriculum during the first three terms. And then at the end of the first, second and third terms, with the advice from the academic advisors, peer mentors, and faculty members from different programs, Students can choose the right major from all the major.
