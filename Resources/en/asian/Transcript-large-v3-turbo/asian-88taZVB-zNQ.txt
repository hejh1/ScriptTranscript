You are the fastest I've ever seen in a fight, in a martial arts fight. That is incredible. And some of those moves in that clip, you hit a guy's fist with your head. I've never seen that before. Because I played a character, he's called Danny. Right. He's like a dog. In the beginning. Right, he's like a mad dog who just knows how to fight. Yeah, he only know how to hurt people. But later on through Morgan Freeman's character, through the music, he starts understanding life. Morgan Freeman's character comes in and helps him sort of learn more. but I identify
I'm a ferocious, destructive machine. Look into my eyes. You can see it, can't you? Yeah. Okay. I need some visine, yeah. You have a secret of self-defense and it's interesting. I heard that you had a secret of self-defense and I was expecting something about a move or something. You said it's an attitude is your secret to self-defense. Just a smile. A smile. Yeah, a smile to people because when you hurt people, they will revenge and then you'll fight again, again, again.
So you just smile, make people happy, then we will stop at work. I hate to disagree with you Jet Li, but all through high school, I tried the smiling at people approach and I got hammered, you know? I wish I'd had a few of your moves. There is a style, a fighting style, and I'm gonna mispronounce it, I'm sure. It's a tzuei chuan. Yeah. Which is the, it's called the drunken style.
Drunk style. Why do they call it drunk style of fighting? Because we create as a movement, like a physical, like drunk guy, you know, physically. But mentally it's very clear. But what would be the advantage of acting like a drunk person in a fight? I obviously, I don't understand. What would be the advantage of doing this? Just the style, you know, when they punch you, you just duck, duck. Oh, I see. You make yourself all kind of rubbery. Yes. And then they hit you and you just sort of flick. Yes.
Am I doing it? Very good, very good. I don't see how this would help me in a fight exactly. So what you're telling me to do is smile and then go like this. That's gonna get me into more fights in New York city. You and I have something in common. You don't like anyone messing with your hair. Is that true? In a fight scene, you really don't like people touching your hair, is that true? No, it's the joke. You know, when I make a movie, the hair last, you know, take care of my hair.
and bother me, bother me. Then I say, okay, okay. One day I talk to people say, you can beat me up, you can kill me, but don't touch my hair. Right, right. Like you, right? Yeah, I hate when I'm about to go do the show, a lot of people come out and they're always touching this beautiful thing. And I'm like, leave it alone, back off. Let the master do his thing. That's what I said. When you, don't laugh at that. When you work, when you, it's very difficult when you work with people who are not martial artists, other movie stars who haven't been trained, You have to be extra careful
with them, don't you? Yes, of course. Like the first time I work in the States, "Lethal Web of War" with Mel Gibson. With Mel Gibson, you work with Mel Gibson, huh? So the director first time tell me, "It's a jet, you can do everything, but it cannot hurt Mel." Don't hurt Mel, right. Yeah, but the first day I work with Mel, I'm very excited, you know, work with a huge star. And I move very quick. After move, Mel said, "Wait a minute, how many hits? How many movement?" I said, "Seven." He said, "Why I only saw two?" Right, right. - You guys are out of school.
Look at how fast that, I can do that too. Look how fast I am. You see that? Because they were drunk. Well, I am drunk. You can smell it. Thank you for the show. Now you are 42 years old. Yes. And you are in incredible shape. You seem like you'd be in the shape of like a 21 year old. How do you do that? How do you stay in shape like that? I meditate every day.
I play some badminton. Badminton. Yes. I'm not learning any of the things that I wanna hear. Smile, act drunk and play badminton. What, does badminton really help you? Yeah, it really help because, you know, I can play anywhere I go. Right. You know, with one people is enough. Right. Not like a basketball, you know, you need five people, 10 people. Right, right. Badminton you can play anywhere in it. Probably good hand to eye coordination.
You can control your body, you know, move. Right, right. Keep out of shape. Yeah. Right. That's fascinating. I'm gonna start taking up badminton. And then people are gonna really beat me up. Well, we mentioned this already, but this movie "Unleash" it's an interesting idea that you are basically someone who was trained. In the movie, your character was never really taught to speak or communicate or have emotions. Your character was just trained to be an attack dog and fight. Yes. And then you end up meeting Morgan Freeman
to help you, but through a good part of the movie, you have to be someone who, for all intents and purposes, is a vicious animal. How did you train for that as an actor? How did you prepare? I played more than 30 movies. I always played tough guy. This is the first time I played mentally only 10 years old. I mean, the first thing I need to work with acting coach, forget who Jet Li is. Right. Forget Jet Li, completely become this other person. Yeah, completely learning this world. Right. I stay in this world for seven months.
I got a very painful, you know, I got a very hurt. Afterwards, the whole year I didn't make movies. So, because it was such a drain to do this one character that afterwards you decide, I'm not gonna make a movie for a year. I just have to- Yeah, very painful. Right. Right, right, to be that person. And also must be hard for the people around you. Yes. Because you become these characters and then other people have to, you take it home with you at the end of the day of shooting probably. Yeah, you know, my lawyer, my manager, everybody say, "Hey, Jet, this is the next movie.
I don't wanna talk about it. I say, "Get out of here. I'm Danny. I'm not Jenny. I don't wanna talk movie business. I only focus on the hair. I'm Danny, Danny." Right, right, right. Well, they live in Hollywood. They're in the industry. I'm sure they know what an attack dog is like. So they'll be fine. But it must be still very weird for them, I would think. You know, for people to be around you when you're in that kind of phase. Yes, very hard for them. You, when you first came to the United States from China, you performed, this is 1974. Is that right?
of a show at the White House and the president was President Nixon at the time. And during that period of time, there were very hostile, cold relationships between the United States and China. When you came to this country, and you stayed in a hotel room, they bugged your room, is that true? Yeah, that I heard when I was in China. Right. Because at that time, two countries not very close, they don't understand each other. So, but I... And so they were... I went to the hotel, I tried to say, They have a real heavy bargain.
in the day of somewhere. I talk to the mirror, talk to the flower, say, "I want chocolate. "I want ice cream." You want chocolate? You want ice cream? Yeah, I want a banana. Yeah. So next morning, you know, when I go to the demonstration, I go back, open the door. I shocked. Everything I ordered, I asked. It was on the table. Just really? They got it for you? Well, that's very nice. That must've made you think, "Well, United States, not so bad." Yeah, very good. At least it's like you're a jack in the box.
At least they're listening, that's nice. Well, Unleashed opens next Friday and really very cool to meet you. I've always really wanted to have you on the show. So thank you so much for being here. You too. Continue success. Gently, let's check in again. We're gonna check in with Jose and Dan at the Borgata Hotel in Atlantic City. And I think they've got Sammy Hagar is doing a guest poll for us. There we go, let's see. What's up, Cone? I'm gonna win you some money, brother.
Nice, all right. Thank you very much. Sammy Hagar, everybody, yeah! This is getting very, very exciting. All right, thank you, Jet Li, Jennifer Espinoza,
