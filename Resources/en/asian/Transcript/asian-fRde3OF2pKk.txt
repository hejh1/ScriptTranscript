television actress Selena Lee is a big name among fans of Hong Kong TV dramas and now she's expanding her reach to another big city yet Singapore. That's right, come February. She will debut in her first Singapore sitcom, although I have to correct that in a shortly called Spouse for House, which will air on MediaCops Channel 5. It's the first time she will be acting in an English language series, so that's a big jump for her. Let's talk to her about how it's been going. Let's welcome actress Selena Lee to the program. Good morning, Selena. Selena, so first up, I said sitcom just there, but I have been informed that she's actually Happy Drawing.
- A lot of sea drums. - Happy, not a sea cums. There's a difference though, is there? - There is a difference. Happy drum because we're all very happy actors.  - In the drum. - Allorectors, Irene, Richard, and Desmond, and in the drummer, we're happy. And outside the drummer, we're also very happy. Like we hang out a lot and then we still have this group chat where all of us part of, and then we still chat once in a while. - Okay, well obviously, acting in English is no problem for you, but how is it different acting here in Singapore
working in Singapore compared to Hong Kong? Actually, no. In English is my first time, so I couldn't really memorize my scripts properly in the beginning because I'm so used to memorizing in Cantonese. So it was a bit weird for me in the beginning. But in terms of filming, it's amazing in Singapore. I love it. I hope it's going to be amazing about it. Well, actually 90% of the time, I think we film about 12 hours a day and that's that's amazing for me because usually the Hong Kong is bad.
16, 20 hours, or sometimes the longest I've gone is like three days without going home. Just keep on going and going and going. So here it's pretty much like a holiday. And so it's a little bit... Does that mean that the production cycle of episodes in Hong Kong is so jam-packed that they just have to push and push and push their actors out? Well, the thing is, there are two sets of crew. So one for the day shift, one for the night shift, but actors are only one set of actors. So we gotta just keep on going and the crew they kinda let us rotate.
12 hours, 12 hours. But in Singapore, we have one set of crews, so everyone gets the same amount of sleep and rest so. And also in Massimation, Paparazzi here don't bother you as much, I imagine, or do they want to have you compare the media coverage? I think Singapore is really nice because I heard the government here, they respect a lot of privacy, of people's privacy, so there's no paparazzi here as far as I'm aware of. If you haven't seen them all, they're following you with camera.
because I understand like back in Hong Kong you've been the subject of quite a lot of paparazzi following in an media interest in not just your work life but your personal life as well. Unfortunately, yeah, it's part of the job but I just hope everyone could just look at these gossip magazines and entertainment news as entertainment only because to be honest I think about 90% at least 90% of the stuff they've written about me it's all fake so I think what's real is my name and my name is Alina. And the picture of you is after all.
Yeah, it's all, it's pretty much fabricated. Even sometimes the pictures aren't accurate, right? Sometimes, yeah, you're like hugging someone, they're like, oh, you're making out. You know? Yes. Yeah, it's like, how do you deal with that? And how do you think you, as a person, have changed in the past 10 years, working in the showroom's industry? Well, initially, it was really tough. Like, I was actually really a little bit sad, and I stayed home a lot. What, I mean, I don't really stay in Hong Kong Bye bye.
usually just travel out because of her privacy. But now I can just like, I see just this entertainment. I don't really read gossip magazines. And I think people should just read it as story books, like a comic book or something that people make up. And don't take it seriously. So now I don't read it. And people tell me about it. I feel like I have to get it.  Do you often get questions that there must be situations where people close to you, like family members and stuff. And they, you know, they can't help it. They're in a newsstand or they see an article or someone asks them about it. Is it true?
this happened. Does that get frustrating for you when you know the truth but you maybe you haven't spoken to them and then they've hearing a sources from other places telling them what's going on and it might not be something that you you totally you know want out there. Well I'm very blessed my family and my close friends they all know me very well so they don't even ask like they read something or they see someone someone tell something they'll be like do you know her personally? Nope well then it's not true right. So then is it frustrating them though because I mean they know you you know they know you personally they must get very frustrated.
when they see like lies and things that aren't true said about you. They must like want to come to your defense. Well, they do when people try to say something they do. I mean, it's natural to them because they want to protect me. But sort of like they've been just very supportive and they don't ask me because they already know a lot of people be asking me. People who don't really know me very well. So they don't really give me any headache or so that's it's really nice. Yeah. Let's talk about more important stuff in your career. At the moment, where do you think you're headed?
at the moment you're kind of branching out overseas away from Hong Kong. Is that where you intend to go? I'd love to explore more into Singapore for sure. I love Singapore. And China, Taiwan, wherever. But I mean, it's not like we really can plan for things to happen. Sometimes things just happen and just go with the flow, especially with our industry. And right now I feel like I'm at a very comfortable spot where all the hard work before you have... I used to work drama after drama after drama.
No holiday, no sleep for like years. And that's the time when you have to work really hard and get exposure and get your name out there. And now I think I'm at the spot where I can do two dramas a year in Hong Kong and then maybe explore elsewhere and take some holidays. So I think I'm very happy right now. It's really easy now. Yeah, I actually have a life and have my own life and then I have work. So I think I found a good balance right now. You mentioned in dramas in Hong Kong. series we're doing here in Singapore is a bit lighter.
It's a happy drama if you like. Is this the first time you're sort of branching into a more sort of comedy or more light-hearted sort of roles? I've done comedies before, but this is the first time where I have, I'm acting with the whole new cast 'cause you know in the Hong Kong TV station, you kind of like already know everyone or at least you've worked with some of the cast, but this time it's like totally brand new. So it's refreshing. -Ellabic Tay, they were showing at the moment and some talented cast members. Did you have any trouble understanding our singlish here?
- That happened. - That was the funny thing because after a while, like I started speaking singlish.  - I'm really? - It's a bit hard to speak. - Okay, I was, I was thinking of you to them. So. - I think you're gonna fit in perfectly in singlish.  - No, actually I think singlish is, it makes the conversation or the sentences everything a bit warmer. Like if you're just like, I'm okay, it sounds really rough, but you're like, oh I'm okay lah, you know, it just sounds sweeter. - Soft. - Yeah, just nice. - The reality of singing poems anyway,
broad. So you know, I'm in cling for you to go back to Canada where you grew up. Now you think you're permanently based in Asia now? Yes, yes. In Toronto my mom is still in Toronto but I visit sometimes but it's actually really cold. Yeah and I actually find, I don't know what I grew up in Toronto back then. I didn't think it was that cold but I lived in the Hong Kong and now I think Hong Kong is cold. It's been a thing of fortune that's too long. I've been heading to warmer and warmer clients is totally uncertain.
- Where is Perfect? I think. - Yeah. - Oh good, thank you so much for coming in and sharing with us your story. - Thank you so much. - Yes, good for watching it.
