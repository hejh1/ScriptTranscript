You are the fastest I've ever seen in a fight. In a martial arts fight. That is incredible. And some of those moves, in that clip, you hit a guy's fist with your head. I've never seen that before. Because I played a character, he's called a Danny. Right. He's like a dog. He's like-- he's the beginning. Right, he's like a mad dog who just knows how to fight. Yeah, he only know how to hurt people. Right. Later on, through Morgan Freeman's character, through the Mill's Acres. Right. He's there. And then the guy-- Morgan Freeman's character comes in and helps him sort of learn more. but you know I identify
I'm a ferocious, destructive machine. Look into my eyes. You can see it, can't you? Yeah. Okay. I need some vizine. Yeah. You have, you know, you have a secret of self-defense. And it's interesting. I heard that you had a secret of self-defense, and I was expecting something about a move or something. You said it's an attitude. Is your secret of self-defense? Yes, a smile. A smile. Yes, a smile to people. Because the way you hurt people, they will revenge. will revenge and then again again again again
Never stop. So you just smile, make people happy, then we will stop work.   Thank you. I hate to disagree with you, Jet Li.  But all through high school, I tried the smiling at people approach, and I got hammered, you know? I wish I'd had a few of your moves. There is a style, a fighting style, and I'm gonna mispronounce it, I'm sure. It's a sway twin. Yeah, which is the, it's called the drunken style.
-Why do they call it drunk style of fighting? -Because we create as a movement like a physical, like a drunk guy, you know, -Right. -physically. But mentally it's very clear. -But what would be the advantage of acting like a drunk person in a fight? I obviously don't understand. What would be the advantage of doing this? -This is just a style, you know, when they punch you, you just duck, duck, and see. -Oh, I see. You make yourself all kind of rubbery. -Yes, so. -And then they hit you and you just sort of like-- -Yes, you know. -Is it my doing it well right now?
-Now, am I doing it? -Very good. Very good. I don't see how this would help me in a fight, exactly. So what you're telling me to do is smile and then go like this. That's going to get me into more fights in New York City. You and I have something in common. You don't like anyone messing with your hair. Is that true? In a fight scene, you really don't like people touching your hair. Is that true? -No. I used to the dog, you know, when I make a movie, they're hurt less, you know, take care of my hair.
and bother me, bother me, and I say, "Okay, okay." One day I talk to people and say, "You can beat me up, "you can kill me, but don't touch my hair." -Right, right. -Like, "You, right." -Right, yeah, I hate what I'm about to go do the show. A lot of people come out and they're always touching this beautiful thing, and I'm like, "Leave it alone. "Back off, let the master do his thing." That's what I said. -Good. -When you -- Don't laugh at that. When you work -- When you -- It's very difficult. When you work with people who are not martial artists, other movie stars who haven't been trained, You have to be extra careful.
-Yes, of course. Like the first time I work in the States, Lito Vedman 4, with Mel Gibson. -With Mel Gibson, you work with Mel Gibson, huh? -So the director first time tell me is a jet. You can do everything, but a cannot hurt Mel. -Don't hurt Mel. -Yeah, right. -But the first day I work with Mel, I'm very exciting in the work of a huge start. -Right, right. -Move very quick. -Right. -After... Mel said, "Wait a minute. How many hits? How many movements?" -Right. -It's a seven. He said, "Why when he saw two?" -Right, right. -When he saw two. -You guys are too... -You guys are too...
Look at how fast I can do that too. Look how fast I am. Did she do it? Because you're a drug. Well, I am drunk. That's it. You can smell it. Smell it. Thank you for the show. Now, you are 42 years old, and you are in credible shape. You seem like you'd be in the shape of like a 21-year-old. How do you do that? How do you stay in shape like that? I meditate every day.
I play some badminton. Badminton, yes. I'm not learning any of the things that I want to hear. Smile, act drunk and play badminton. What-- How has badminton really helped you? Yeah, it really helped, because I can play anywhere at goal. Right. And always one people is enough. Right. Not like a basketball, you know, you need to five people, ten people. Right, right. Badminton, you can play anywhere. and it probably to good hand to eye coordination.
-You can then throw your body in a move. -Right. Keep that shape. -Right. -Right. That's fascinating. I'm going to start taking a bad minute. And then people are going to really beat me up. Now, you -- We mentioned this already, but this movie unleashes interesting idea that you are basically someone who was trained -- in the movie, your character was never really taught to speak or communicate or have emotions. Your character was just trained to be an attack dog and fight. -Yes. -And then you end up meeting Morgan Freeman
to help you, but through a good part of the movie, you have to be someone who, in front of his purpose, is a vicious animal. How did you train for that as an actor? How did you prepare? I played more than 30 movies. I always played tough guys. This is the first time I play mentally only 10 years old. I need the first thing I need to work with acting coach for God, who Jelly is. Right. Forget, Jet Lee completely become the first learning this Denny's world. But I stay in this world for seven minutes.
I got a very painful, you know. I got a very hurt. After worse, the whole year, I did make movies. -So because it was such a drain to do this one character that afterwards you decide I'm not gonna make a movie for a year, I just have to-- -Yeah, very painful. -Right. -I'm a character. -Right, right, to be that person. And also must be hard for the people around you. -Yes, when you're-- -Because you become these characters, and then other people have to-- You take it home with you at the end of the day of shooting, probably. -Yeah, you know, my lawyer, my manager, everybody say hey jet this is the next movie we want to
I'm gonna talk about it. I say, "Get out of here. I'm Danny. I'm not jelly. I don't want to talk about movie business. I only focus on the hair. I'm Danny. Right, right, right. Well, they live in Hollywood. They're in the industry. I'm sure they know what an attack dog is like. So they'll be fine. But it must be still very weird for them, I would think. You know, for people to be around you when you're in that kind of phase. Yes, very hard for them. You, when you first came to the United States from China, you performed, this is 1974. - Is that right? - Yes. - You performed as part of the show.
of a show at the White House, and the president was President Nixon at the time. And during that period of time, there were very hostile, cold relationships between the United States and China. When you came to this country, and you stayed in the hotel room, they bugged your room, is that true? Yeah, that's what I heard when I was in China. Right. Because at that time, two countries never closed, they don't understand each other. So, but I... And so, they went to the hotel. I tried to say they're having real havoc back.
He's in there somewhere. I talk to the mirror, talk to the flower, I say. -You know, I want to chuckle it. I want to... I want to ask you. You want chocolate? You want ice cream? -Yeah, I want a banana. -Yeah. So next morning, you know, when I go to the demonstration, I go back open the door. I shocked. Everything I watered. I asked, and he's on the pinhole.  -Just really? They got it for you? Well, that's very nice. That must have made me think... -Well, the United States not so bad. -Yeah, they were good. At least they're like you're a jack in the box.
at least they're listening, that's nice. Well, unleashed opens next Friday, and really very cool to meet you. I was really wanted to have you on the show. So thank you so much for being here. - You're welcome. - You can't get a success. - Jetley, let's check in again. We're gonna check in with Jose and Dan at the Volgata Hotel in Atlantic City, and I think they've got Sammy Hagar is doing a guest pool for us. There we go, let's see. - Let's have fun. I'm gonna win you somebody, brother.
Nice, all right. Thank you very much, Sammy Hague, everybody. Yeah!  Oh, it has been a very-- this is getting very, very exciting. All right, thank you, Jet Leigh, Jennifer S.
