My name is Easton Chan and I am a singer actor, mainly a singer. Music is, I mean, getting out of bed in the morning or going to sleep, I need music. Without music, I don't think... Well, I don't think there's no music ever.
Music is, it gives me a lot of, oh, it gives life to me actually. That's music. Passion sounds like a great word. Passion is, I think, is inborn. I think is a human being. Of course we have the downsize on time, but...
You see, that's passion. Yeah, people, they don't want to go, you know, the musicians. Passion is something we need to ponder on in life, definitely.
I think at a very young age I discovered the passion for music. I think everybody needs. Everybody loves music. I don't believe anyone who doesn't like music.
There is no... no, there's absolutely no music I dislike. I like rock music. Actually I do like rock music. I like... well, do I have to name the band? I just saw... I like fusion, actually. Like lately I just saw the Gorillas show in Hong Kong, the plastic beach tour.
And they're great. It's just a mixture of woodwind with the strings and chamber music and also the esafrican music with great visuals and a British rock band. And I like mix it. I like fusion. I like everything Mars Davis. I like Madonna and like Bowie. I like
You too, everything basically. Jimmy Hendrix, Lenny Kravitz, I don't know, Jemar Kwae in Cognito. I can't get on. I'm sorry.
I think the ice moment for music is the ice moment for life. You know, we get stuck in at some point. I think everyone does get stuck in life when you have too much work. And that time, my work is very much related to music. So when I'm stuck, I just go for holiday.
hide away, go to course and work or even stay home, read a book. Just think about nothing you had, disconnect, isolate yourself for a little bit and then you get bored and then you get back to life again.
Wow. At this moment, well, there's so many options, but this moment I can think of the Beatles in my life.
I don't think I could be a policeman or fireman. I try studying architects. But I don't know. I mean, I've been in this business for 15 years, or it was a career. So I don't think I know any other capabilities.  I don't know anything else apart from, well, I guess I could do social work.
society maybe, you know, and because I like talking a lot, so I guess I could be a social worker and, you know, trying to talk someone out of, you know, if they're thinking the wrong way, like trying to end themselves or something, you know. "I know life is good, it's beautiful, sing your song."
心理是…很棒的,因為我當時很年輕我以前在家裡拍攝我的歌曲「Kanto Pop」的歌曲是叫「Jackie Chung」的歌曲我不知道為什麼,我當時在玩的歌曲在Kanto拍攝的歌曲,他跟著說「好」「青春青春華」 青春青春…他可以說是「Kentany Song」
The central pop is like the synthesizers they use. I think it's the arrangement.  The chord progressions kind of repeat themselves. This is something I think it's... It's because I'm very nosy. I like to listen to different music, even thrash music.  that kind of stuff.
You know, and trying to, since I'm kind of a little bit of influential, influential reality, no, whatever, you know, influence on the, on the, in the, in the, um, creative China region, I'm trying to just try different genres of music rather than just the synthesizers, you know, the, that's what I've been told when I was young.
on my schoolmates ago. Oh no, you know that's a, that's a Chinese song. I go, yeah, whatever. I like it, so. Start off. I say, oh, yeah, I love him. He's the best player. How do I think I'm connected to him? Well, I love football because Hong Kong, we, at primary school level, we play football. That's what you call it, soccer.
one of the main sports in... and of course I'm a big fan of football. Well, soccer. Same thing. And Messi, I think he has passion. He can tell. I mean, he's got a quick mind. He's smart and... and it's very entertaining watching him play. Because he's... he's passionately enjoying himself on the pitch,
So yeah, I think I, it's like me enjoying myself on stage and well, sometimes I get a little bit over the top. I'm not too familiar with basketball players. I only know they're tall. That's not enough. Of course, bags. Come on. Yeah. I wish I had a good time.
That is body.  And I think a lot of kids look up to him as if you've seen him play when he was like young at the club or as an English player until now he's-- I don't know if some people are just born with a lot of influence to other people. and I think he's doing a lot of good.
And then he's had his bad times, you know, getting the red cards, you know, the World Cup and, you know, you know, the fused went off kind of that kind of stuff, but it's they're good examples. He's just human and he's he and he's he's definitely got passion to life, not just, not just football himself and he's contributing back. He's got this football score and everything and to to to to to
encouraged a sport and a spirit, the good spirit. I've seen that name. I don't know if I've heard of her music. I'm sure he's pretty good. Li Bing Bing? The actress? Yeah, of course. She's in a lot of good movies and she can definitely act very well as an actor.
我希望你能做好好的工作。嗨,李平平,希望你有機會可以給你合作。那是我的男朋友,我能做好好的工作。
