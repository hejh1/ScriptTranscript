Cambodia is a country of 17 million people when it's historical roots traceable to the ancient Khmer Empire. The empire at its peak encompassed vast weights of mainland Southeast Asia. And indeed, it's crowned you all, the Angkor Wat remains one of the most popular tourism attractions in the region today.
The past 70 years have not been easy on Cambodia. Indeed, ethnic strife, abhorrent political violence, and extensively in fighting have left the scars across most of this country. And yet, for ordinary Cambodians, the royalty has indeed served as a critical pillar of stability and hope amidst upheaval and turmoil.
Today, Cambodia stands as amongst the fastest growing economies in Asia. Between 1995 and 2019, Cambodia clocked in an average annual growth rate of 7.6%. Testament to its advantages in terms of the young and abundant labour, sheep wages, proximate access to critical raw materials, and of course, its enduring strength in terms of the pro-free market policies adopted by the government.
And yet amidst intensifying geopolitical rivalry, as well as realignment to supply chains in a region, how will Cambodia fare for the coming years? Well, answering that question is what brings us to nom ten today. Dr Soxopana is the senior minister in charge of special missions and chairman of the Trade Policy Advisory Board of the Royal Government of Cambodia. He is a seasoned diplomat lawyer academic.
and public servant with significant experience navigating ASEON and shaping Cambodia's policies in multilateral institutions. Hello, Mr. Pan, thank you so much for your time and for your love and your beautiful, beautiful, beautiful politics next to my students, but also, you know, this is a collaborative. Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Sapan, it's such a pleasure to be here in this gorgeous room as well to spend time with you. I want to just start off with a question on trade. You've led many a high level delegation to
some of the most prominent international conferences on trade. WTO, UNCTAD, World Economic Forum, and many of these you've conversed with the leaders and heads of over the past couple of years, really. So from their perspective, what do you see as the elements of the Cambodian economy and trade that get them most excited? And what do they see as the sort of relative impediments or obstacles they would like to see overcome in order for Cambodia to be further integrated into global trade.
Well, I will have to go back some 20 plus years when I negotiated the accession of Cambodia to the BTO. I was saying the overwhelming effect of trade was felt at that time because the BTO is the game changer for Cambodia. After emerging from the Civil War,
Basically, Cambodia didn't have anything. We didn't have the resource, we didn't have the capital, we didn't have the intellectual dimension of people, most of people perish during the killing field. So we first started from empty hand. And it was WTO that really enabled us to really kick start our trade process. and with the vision.
with you or this benefit that rise from accession, we've been able to really sustain about up to COVID time, 20 years of economic growth. Study, 7%, 67%, steady for 2 decades. But fast forward 20 years later now, the situation is quite different. We are dealing with a world full of uncertainty.
the war on Ukraine and recently in the Middle East. So I think the situation is not the same as when somebody has a lot of challenge on liberal order, a lot of challenge on democracy. So I would say Cambodia would have to navigate throughout the next couple of years or even decade through this particular
moment where I would say not everything is straightforward. And then you have other emerging issue, climate change issue, carbon offset, fintech. He comes for that matter even. Even he comes. 20 years ago, what he comes. Of course, Cambodia is small country. So we're more flexible, we're more nimble. We can adjust quite fast.
We don't have a massive population to go through a bureaucracy till we should point that we have to make a policy decision with small country. Now we have a young government, a prime minister's 46 years old, PhD in economy. So I mean, he understands all these dynamics. Yeah. So I was just wondering, given that China is your largest training partner, followed subsequently
Vietnam, US, Thailand and then Japan, how will Cambodia be positioning itself for the coming 10 years in relation to China and the US? Do you see it as possible for Cambodia to remain balanced and hedged given the present dynamics? I would say the philosophy of Cambodia is very simple. We need friends. One enemy is one enemy too much. We need friends.
And if we look at our trade composition, most of our trade government, footwear, travel bag, go to America, go to Europe. Most of our agriculture products go to China. So I would say there's a place under the sun for everybody. So in this case, for Cambodia, there's a place under the sun for our various product and export good, right? We will continue to...
look at the US in terms of travel bag, footwear, garment, because let's say they 40% of our export go to the US, even though we do pay duties, but it's okay. The industry is doing quite well. So the EU, yes, it is there. Now the UK is outside Brexit. They give us some very good trade preference under the developing country preferential trading scheme. We're doing well, right? And I would say up to three.
years ago when the EU tried to remove a trade preference under the EBA, that's when we, because at that time there's some, you know, the main issue is with some human right issue, but we say, look, we cannot trade sovereignty and with trade preference. That's not something that we trade. But that was the time that we realized that we have to diversify.
China for that matter came to our ratio to be fair, to be fair. China came and we, and China were the first Cambodia, China, free trade agreement we negotiated. And we did it. And from there on, other free trade agreement followed with the Korea, with the United Arab Emirates. But the good thing now, the good thing is that we have asset. I said historically, I think it was a...
And I would say it's a coincidence that Asap negotiation won a launch during the Cambodian championship of ASEAN 2012. And it conclude 10 years later when all the member country ratified, of course, minus India, it was ratifying and turned to force 10 years later when we had the third ASEAN championship. So, as a is the second wave.
The video is first wave. Asset is a second wave. For us, we see opportunity arising from market access opened under Asset. At the end of the day, we have a very good relation with all country. Of course, the narrative is sometimes a bit hard on us. Because of the U.S.-China attention, there are some people who are favoring and they pushed an attitude.
But we're okay, we're okay. We manage, all right. We manage, all right. One thing that you said just then, I picked up on, I found fascinating, is you said, you will not trade off sovereignty for trade preferences. And I find that fascinating, because very often, when we see international discourses or discussions of Cambodia, it bemuses and baffles me to see how much of the potential in a value in this country is overlooked by commentators when they choose to pick and choose certain elements so they focus on or they amplify.
whether it be in terms of their values or contravention of principles, they hold dear in the West or in other parts of the world. And as someone who is so prominent in a trade negotiation process, in representing Cambodia really as an international spokesperson in many ways, how have you sought to convince skeptics? Maybe not those who are inherently predisposed against Cambodia, but just skeptics? And folks who know not so much about this country, you know, or know not as much as a short right about this country, how do you go about persuading them to see
the merits and also the virtues of the Cambodian state and economy. Is it challenging? Is it tough? I think the one thing that helped me is that I'm not much of a diplomat. I'm not much of a diplomat. I'm more a free thinker. I'm an academic, I'm a private sector. Occasionally I'm a diplomat. So is that versatility that enables me to push myself?
narrative as well, my counter narrative as well. Of course I wouldn't push in front of a hundred people on a microphone. There are certain things as a good diplomat you do not want to cross the line. But a good coffee, a good lunch, have a frank talk, a straight talk, you cut the hypocrisy out. And you have to say that with many
most of them, when you have this private talk, they do accept your argument. You know, they do know that there's a lot of hypocrisy in there. And they would, if you're honest, if you're straightforward, if you're hard enough on your position, on your principal, they will have to accept it. But you got to find the right moment, the right time, the right place to pass a message. And they will respect you for that.
Are you concerned about the pace of globalization? Are we going, are we moving backwards? You know, are we witnessing a regression in globalization that renders this pursuit of free trade? 1.0, WTO 2.0, our set, kind of obsolete? I remember when Cambodia, in a piece, a process in 1993, when we have a piece, there was a Washington consensus in our piece, record that we saw.
the West to be fair, to be fair to the West. The West won Cambodia as a post-war genocide country to use democracy and deliver order, free market, to rebuild a post-war devastated economy to be a well-to-do, prosperous country. Which was great, which was great.
I would look at other countries. It's not the case. Look at Europe now. I mean, there's so many losers from the globalization process. Then winner. I probably should use the word globalization. I should use the word regular globalization 2.0. Now we have rethinking. I don't think we are de-globalized. I don't think so. The world is too connected.
A regular organisation is a better word. We still do business together. But all in all, I would say, you know, we have to really think how are we going to bring a more equitable source of wealth to people where the rich or the poor? So I was just wondering, Dr. Sapan, are you worried about folks also losing out out from this re-globalisation wave here in Cambodia.
And on that, you know, front, what exactly can be done to help them transition and acclimatise through the challenges that lie ahead? A normal country would probably, if Cambodia is a normal country, didn't have the ward, didn't have genocide, didn't have all this negative history, I should be worried. But the case Cambodia is very unique. Because we went through the genocide, we lost everything.
When we have the peace process, we start from scratch. We start from zero base. We didn't have anything to protect. We didn't have any industry. We didn't have money. We didn't have saving. We didn't have knowledge. We got nothing. So in that sense, we're used to a pain threshold is very high.
- Every year, fast forward from the peace process, we are where we are now, a perspiration nation, okay? And the beauty is that for the last 20 years, most of the people in parent, those who can afford to send their kids to good school, days and they get to good school.
if they could send them to Australia, or Singapore, whatever. For the last 15 or 20 years, we have sent our kids to study abroad. Most of them are back now, with the master, with the PhD, with the bachelor, they back in Cambodia now. They're helping their parents who are mom and pop trade 20 years ago. So we have a young population.
well-educated now, speak good English. And they're there now helping their parents move up the quality of their business side, right? We are reaching out to build a capacity of the association, of the industry, of the sector, how to be a better, a more competitive, you know, business. So that's what we're going through now.
government objective is to help build a capacity of our, in this case, for example, our cashier net. Because, look, we have about 700,000 metric ton of cashier net net net. We're number two after Godivore. Godivore number one. We are exporting 95% of Vietnam. So we're only processing about 5%. We're focused on that.
now on processing. You know, cash, you're not how can we establish a cash or a national park. Our private sector are now in position to step in. So I'm not too worried about that. Yeah. Because the environment is very different. Yeah. Dr. Sapan, you've had a great time.
incredible career. I want to ask you, given the hardships that your countries endured an experience, but also your own personal hardships and predicaments, how have you sought to navigate these times of lows, these difficult moments in your life? What are your tips or reflections on endurance and perseverance? I think when you survive the killing fear, as I said earlier, is that the
your pain threshold is so high, everything is like a walk in the park. So that's how I see it. If you have a bad day, you have a good night's sleep. And the next day will be a better day. And how I navigate, you know, in a post-killing field period was all about benchmarking that pain.
I have a rough day. Nobody's going to kill me at the night. So, oh good, I feel better. I have a long discussion, hard, tough negotiation with the counterpart. Well, you know, it couldn't be as bad as the killing feel. So, I would say in relative term is that pain threshold, that sort of keep me zen, keep me very zen.
I look at that life is what you make it. You can allow your emotion to carry away, or you can control, you know, so that you can remain as zen as possible. You cannot describe that, that the difficulty, the pain, the misery, the hardship. So that's how I benchmark. - In a piece through benchmarking, through putting into perspective.
experience. Everything is relative. Everything is relative. Now I want to move on to actually the question of cultural relativism and value pluralism as well, seeing as you mentioned relative. You founded the Asian Vision Institute which is a very prominent leading think tank in the region and a core part of its mission is to promote what you term important dialogues and conversations and infusing them with an Asian perspective. Do you personally believe there are unique Asian values as
a person who went through the killing field, I have seen the worst what a human can do to other, it's quite clear. But we also have to be mindful that each country, we have our own culture. And you and my country, you know, I mean, the sense of respect is very high. You know, when I was a vice minister 25 years ago, I was the youngest.
in the cabinet. I have to, because of my culture, I have to be very polite, I have to be very cutuous to my elder, for example. And I think, you may have a good argument, but if you put it in a wrong perspective, a context, your argument will not be bought. So in a way that mutual respect is so important. Take, for example, when we finish the war, when we end up
war, we have so many landmines, more than mine than people. The world helped us. Now, you know what, we become the demeanor of the world now. A troop, a UN peacekeeping force, we go demanding in other countries, a peacekeeping force out there. We want to give back to society to the world. The ecosystem, the cultural thing that we have now,
It's a good example on how Cambodia turn a cultural asset to be the economic asset. So I would say Cambodia is in position to give back a lot to the world now. And on that, you know, what you said, they're really touched to me as a born and raised Hong Konger having spent 17 years in my home city. I decided to go back home as well after finishing off my PhD. And of course it behoves me to ask you a question about Hong Kong.
you know, place for which I feel very strong sense of affinity. You've been to Hong Kong several times. What can Hong Kong do better to help Cambodia and to work with Cambodia and vice versa in your opinion? For the last 15 years, the role of Hong Kong is very important for Cambodia. In the sense that Hong Kong have a core intellectual, lawyer, accountant, professional.
or consultant. These are the people at the time when the Belen Road was just launched. You know, we look a lot to Hong Kong to serve as a bridge. To serve as a bridge with mainland China. So I think the strength of Hong Kong still remain the same that you have this high intellectual capacity. You know, in the region, in Asia, Hong Kong is still considered as a bridge.
where a lot of things of high intellectual value are there? - It's wonderful to spend time with you today. Thank you very, very much for your generosity and remarks and insights. We really appreciate it. - Thank you. - As a country, as a people, Cambodia's been through a lot. The past few decades have by no means been easy
country with extensive suffering and devastation. And yet, if there's one lesson I could draw from my conversation with a wonderful doctor, Sapana, it is that ultimately, to recover from trauma and pain requires more than just resilience. It requires courage and creativity. Courage to stay true to whom we truly are, courage to speak truth to power, and courage to recognize that our past and histories
even though they do teach us. And at the very same time, creativity is how small and medium-powered thrive at times of increasing geopolitical volatility. These are all instrumental parts of Cambodia's inimitable modernization story.
