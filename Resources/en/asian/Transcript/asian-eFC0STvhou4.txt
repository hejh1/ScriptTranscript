Hi, I'm Shiga Lin and you're watching the AU Review. I'm talking about your reign. You are coming to Australia very soon. Can you tell us a little bit about this trip coming up? Yeah, I'm actually really excited and ever since I've been a singer, I'm actually really surprise how often we get to try.
travel to Australia because I get to travel to Australia maybe at least once or twice a year and it's because their Asian market is actually a lot bigger than I thought and so and therefore we have the opportunity to perform there and this coming September we're going to have a show there it's actually not my show but it's like Pac-Hose concert in Melbourne and I feel really lucky because every time he has a show he'll always bring me along to be his guest So I think that's like really cool like a kind of he he I love
look up to him like a older brother. So I really appreciate how he always like tries to give me these opportunities in terms of performing in different places. So they're coming in September to Melbourne. So get your tickets online. Like I'm seeing us. You can tell you've been to Australia before because you pronounced Melbourne correctly. Really how do people pronounce it? Well some people pronounce it Melbourne. Oh Melbourne. It's actually Melbourne. A Melbourne. Yeah. So you actually pronounce it - I think it's because I have a really strong American accent.
So I don't know actually maybe maybe like I guess it's the accent thing could be talking about I guess Australia What's your what's your favorite memory of Australia when you when you visit last time? Definitely the food Because I love seafood and I've been to Sydney's Is it the something market fish market? Yeah, the fish market and it's amazing And I remember going with my manager. We went at 7 o'clock in the morning.
We're having oysters. Yeah, because we didn't have any other time and basically every time I travel to Australia it's always like a three-day trip. Yeah, and it's intense. So you think of the stay a while have a look around? Exactly, but we do heat a lot so every time I go to I go to like Australia I always gain weight when I come back but basically we didn't have time to go to the fish market So it was the only chance to go before our flight so we had to go seven in the morning and we're having like two dozens of
oysters, scampies, oony, and I was like, oh my god, I love seafood but I'm bloated. But it was a fun experience because it was like so fresh. Yeah, talk about movies. You shot a film this year. Can you tell us a little bit about this film when Geek meets serial killer? Yeah, as you can tell from the name, it's actually a funny movie, it's a black humor, and It's about a guy, actually two guys, meeting each other.
and the internet and how they started to bond through the internet and then after they met they started killing people together. So for me I was just playing a role of one of the guys' girlfriends. So I kind of had like, I was kind of like schizophrenia. So I kind of had like two sides of my personality. like one side is like a very innocent, really home-grown.
girl, kind of like the girl like story, kind of girl. And the other side is more vicious and more devious and has a lot of mind games playing that kind of character. So it was quite interesting trying to play both sides. But I think the biggest challenge in this movie is that I actually tried to, I was able to try out wires and like fighting scenes and killing scenes. And that's like something I've never tried before. So I think this was
Is it a role that you really want to play in the future? Is it particular stuff? I really want to try a real, like, straight on fighting role. But this wasn't a straight on fighting role, but it was a good chance for me to learn about it. Because I'm never known how it's like to work with a stunt or work with wires or having to practice how it's like to have a fight seen in a movie.
But after I tried, I'm actually even more interested in it. So I'm... Plans are a rest of this year. Besides coming to Australia and the album and your movie, I can't keep track of you, of course, because you're doing so much. Any other plans for the rest of this year? Yeah, I'm going to do a... This is not music related though, but I'm gonna do a half marathon. Oh, yes, I see you've been training on your Instagram. So basically, I think Hong Kong artists are more
Like they try everything like apart from just singing and acting and maybe TV series like We have like a lot of other stuff going on on the side as well So maybe some artists would do like businesses like I don't know like maybe in food and beverage or fashion Or fashion and for me I haven't I picked up another interest and that's running so Marathon running. Yeah, well actually this is kind of related to my work and what I'm doing right now because I started running.
before because I really wanted it to help me singing because yeah the whole breathing thing and at first I really didn't like to exercise that much because I never really exercised throughout my childhood years but I really had to force myself and push myself in the beginning and then right after I completed my first 10 kilometer marathon it was just it was I felt great and then ever since I was like really addicted to it because it just gave me like a great feel of success.
I just wanted to push myself further and like after entering like a few 10 kilometer marathons I feel like it's about time to try something more so a proper one yeah like a proper one so so I entered the 21 kilometer race this year wow and that's coming up soon in September right before Melbourne wow so I'm gonna have I'm gonna be like really busy training with like my my singing and performing and working and running.
So it's pretty cool. I guess lastly do you have a message for your fans who may be watching this video right now? Oh, hi everyone in Australia or anywhere else in the world. I'm Shiga and I love to sing and I hope my songs touches your heart and if you are living in Melbourne Remember to buy our tickets and come down and see us in September
