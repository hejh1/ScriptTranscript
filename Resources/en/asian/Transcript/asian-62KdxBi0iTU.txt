Why did you want to play a blind person? Actually, it's from newspaper because I read some critics about some lawyer that is blind. Yeah, they did very good jobs in their lifetime. So I want to be one of that kind of character.
So Johnny, can I be a Brian lawyer? Sure, you can, sure you can. You learn more and then you practice more, you can be. Could you tell us a little bit about your experience at the festival that year? It was really great and never expected. And as a nation actor, I was really honoured to have a chance to win international awards.
It means a lot to me, it means a lot to me. I'm very happy. After the obvious years, as an actor, and finally, you've got recognition from people from different countries. And I'm really amazed. One place I go often now is South Africa. And I'm not talking about Johannesburg or Cape Town. I live a stand-in place that's there.
It's a farm country. Big, big open land, big, big open skies. And the place I stay is a traditional African hut. Inside is very comfortable, but no electricity. So the challenge there is to try and learn how to live without the creature comforts that you're used to, like a computer, like a TV, like your cell phone. I'm Rivella from TVB. And we live from Hong Kong, as we be.
It's really nice to be here and so I'm sorry I like to rain for so much. I hope we can go to the green world. I think I'll really enjoy working here. Just all the people who are so professional and so nice and so quiet.
thinking to myself, what the hell am I going to do at Google? Seriously, because you guys are the people I go to when I look at my stuff. Seriously, it could be through the search engine. It could be through maps. I like to travel a lot. I just want to unpack and just wander off somewhere into the world and see the world. So I'm always navigating through maps. And lately, actually, speaking of which, I've been trying to pick up on more Japanese.
Is it the first time you meet me? Yes, my first time at a movie festival. And also first time, Rick Hoppin, Hong Kong. So what are you going to do tonight? Are you going to perform? I'm performing tonight. Right, so how do you feel? I don't know, I still got a tight right now. This outfit, you see? I'm like filling out out of my suit. You've been in the showbiz for 20 years? Yeah, pretty much. 21 years. You know, just like any changes.
I actually think the creativity and the making of the music is just improving and improving. The ways of listening to music or promoting music is slightly different, that's all. What do you think about that? Who's saying you can't talk to people? You're very sugar-reaving, very... It's really driven by the lyrics a lot, but then it's getting used to something. gives me more motivation to motivation.
to actually make other songs. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to sincerely thank the University of West London and London College of Music for bestowing this honorary degree upon me. I would also like to show my appreciation towards Vice-Chancellor Professor Peter John for traveling all the way from London and also Professor Howard. Thank you. Your esteem presence is truly humbling for me and welcome to Hong Kong.
I'm definitely grateful and blessed to have received this honor from such prestigious and renowned college. Why do you think you have continued to endure and be so popular as you are for so long? I don't know. The one theory that I believe is you have to keep working.
Well, as an artist, I mean, people just look at what you work. Some new people, my love, your new things, some people I love your old things. You got to keep doing something. Once I was new to the other singers actually, now I'm one of the very senior singers.
And so that's quite normal to me actually. And I think the scenes need more new blood. Yeah.
I think one common mistake that a lot of people do is saying it's good for China. It's good for China. So people watch a movie that's Chinese and they say, "Oh, that was a good movie for a Chinese movie." And for me, that doesn't cut it. That doesn't make sense to me, do you understand? A movie is a movie. It shouldn't be all because it's a Chinese movie. There's lower standards. to understand that the love
of quality of work does not differ in different countries. A lot of us maybe already thinking everyone's like China's the next market. China's the next superpower. China's this and China's that. Okay, there's a lot of money to be made there. Okay, sure. But you cannot lose the integrity of what you do and what you represent for money.
What time is it? 5.30. When I was 17 years old, I participated in a singing contest. I really want to try to be an artist. I want the competition. That's how I started my career. What do I do to waste my time? The PBL system is actually a really flexible kind of teaching method. And it can allow the students to either go really indefinitely to one of the specific topics.
