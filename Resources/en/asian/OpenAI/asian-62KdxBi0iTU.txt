Why did you want to play a blind person? Actually it's from newspaper because I read some, you know, critics about some lawyer that is blind. They did very good jobs in their lifetime So I want to be one of that kind of character So I just ask, Johnny, can I be a blind lawyer? Sure you can, sure you can You learn more and then you practice more, you can be Could you tell us a little bit about your experience at the festival that year? It was really great, I never expected But as an Asian actor I was really honored to have a chance to win international awards It means a lot to me, it means a lot to me I'm very happy after all these years as an actor And finally you got recognition from people from different countries I'm really amazed One place I go often now is South Africa And I'm not talking about Johannesburg or Cape Town I stay in a place that is farm country Big, big open land, big, big open skies And the place I stay is a traditional African hut Inside is very comfortable but no electricity So the challenge there is to try to learn how to live without the creature comforts that you're used to Like a computer, like a TV, like your cell phone Hello, I'm Rayman Lam from TVB And we're from Hong Kong, TVB And it's really nice to be here And so sorry, I like to create so much And I hope we can come to Korea more often I think I really enjoy working here Because all the people here are so professional And so nice and so quiet I was thinking to myself, what the hell am I going to do at Google? Because you guys are the people I go to when I look at my stuff, seriously It could be through the search engine It could be through maps I like to travel a lot, I like to throw on a backpack And just wander off somewhere into the world and see the world So I'm always navigating through maps And lately actually, speaking of which I've been trying to pick up on more Japanese Yes, my first time at a movie festival And also first time red carpet in Hong Kong I'm performing tonight, that's why I don't know, I feel kind of tight right now in this outfit You see, I'm like spilling out of my suit 20 years, yeah, pretty much, 21 Have you noticed any changes throughout the years? I actually think the creativity and the making of the music Is just improving and improving The ways of listening to music or promoting music is slightly different, that's all What do you think about people saying mainstream capital Being very sugary, being very... It's really driven by the lyrics a lot But then it's getting used to something It gives me more motivation to actually make other songs Good evening ladies and gentlemen I would like to sincerely thank the University of West London And London College of Music For bestowing this honorary degree upon me I would also like to show my appreciation towards Vice-Chancellor Professor Peter John For travelling all the way from London And also Professor Howard, thank you Your esteemed presence is truly humbling for me And welcome to Hong Kong I'm definitely grateful and blessed To have received this honour From such a prestigious and renowned college Why do you think you have continued To endure and be so popular as you are For so long? I don't know The one theory that I believe Is you have to keep working As an artist, people just look at your work Some new people might love your new things Some people might love your old things So you gotta keep doing something Once I was new to the other singers Now I'm one of the very senior singers So that's quite normal to me actually And I think the scenes need more new blood I think one common mistake That a lot of people do Is saying it's good for China It's good for China So people watch a movie that's Chinese And they say oh that was a good movie For a Chinese movie And for me that doesn't cut it That doesn't make sense to me Do you understand? A movie is a movie It shouldn't be Oh because it's a Chinese movie So the way to get lower standards Is to understand that the level of quality of work Does not differ in different countries A lot of us may be already thinking Everyone's like China's the next market China's the next superpower China's this and China's that Okay there's a lot of money to be made there Okay sure But you cannot lose the integrity of what you do And what you represent for money What time is it? 5.30 When I was 17 years old I participated in a singing contest I really wanted to try to be an artist I won the competition That's how I started my career What do I do to waste my time?
