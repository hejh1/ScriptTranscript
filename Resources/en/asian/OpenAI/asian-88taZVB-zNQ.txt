You are the fastest I've ever seen in a fight, in a martial arts fight. That is incredible. And some of those moves, in that clip, you hit a guy's fist with your head. I've never seen that before. Because I played a character. He's called Danny. Right. He's like a dog. He's like, he's the beginning. Right. He's like a, he's like a mad dog who just knows how to fight. Yeah. He only know how to hurt people. But later on through Morgan Freeman's character, through the music. Right. He starts to understand. Morgan Freeman's character comes in and helps him sort of learn more. But, you know, I identify with that character. I, too, am a ferocious, destructive machine. Look into my eyes. You can see it, can't you? Yeah. Okay. Need some Visine. Yeah. You have, you know, you have a secret of self-defense. And it's, it's interesting. It's, I heard that you had a secret of self-defense. And I was expecting something about a move or something. You said it's an attitude is your secret to self-defense. Just a smile. A smile. Yeah. A smile to people. Because when you hurt people, they will revenge. And then you fight again, again, again. Never stop. So just smile. Make people happy. Then we will stop war. I hate to disagree with you, Jet Li. But all through high school, I tried the smiling at people approach. And I got hammered, you know. I wish I'd had a few of your moves. There is a style, a fighting style. And I'm going to mispronounce it. I'm sure. It's a Sui Quan. Yeah. Which is a, which is the, it's called the drunken style. Yes. Drunk style. Why, why do they call it drunk style of fighting? Because we create as a movement, like a physical, like a drunk guy, you know. Right. Physically. But mentally, it's very clear. But what would be the advantage of acting like a drunk person in a fight? I obviously, I don't understand. What would be the advantage of doing this? The style, you know, when they punch you, it's duck, duck. Oh, I see. You made yourself all kind of rubbery. Yes. And then they hit you and you just sort of like. Yes. You know, am I doing it well right now? Am I doing it? Very good. Very good. I don't see how this would, I don't see how this would help me in a fight. Exactly. So what you're telling me to do is smile and then go like this. That's going to get me into more fights in New York City. You and I have something in common. You don't like anyone messing with your hair. Is that true? In a fight scene, you really don't like people touching your hair. Is that true? No, no. It's a joke. You know, when I make a movie, the hairless, you know, take care of my hair. He always bother me and bother me, bother me. Then I say, OK, OK. One day I talk to people, say, you can beat me up. You can kill me, but don't touch my hair. All right. Right. Right. Yeah. I hate when I'm about to go do the show. A lot of people come out and they're always touching this beautiful thing. And I'm like, leave it alone. Back off. Let the master do his thing. That's what I say. When you don't laugh at that. When you work, when you it's very difficult when you work with people who are not martial artists, other movie stars who haven't been trained, you have to be extra careful with them, don't you? Yes, of course. Like the first time I work in the States, Little Women 4 with Mel Gibson. With Mel Gibson. You work with Mel Gibson, huh? The director first time tell me it's a jet. You can do everything, but it cannot hurt Mel. Don't hurt Mel. Yeah. But the first day I work with Mel, I'm very excited, you know, work with a huge star. Right, right. Move very quick. Right. After move, Mel said, wait a minute. How many hits? How many movement? Right. I said seven. He said, why? I only saw two. Right, right. I only saw two of them. Look at how fast. I can do that too. Look how fast I am. Because you're drunk. Well, I am drunk. You can smell it. Wow. Thank you for the show. Now, you are, you are, you're 42 years old. Yes. And you are in incredible shape. You seem like you'd be in the shape of like a 21-year-old. How do you do that? How do you stay in shape like that? I meditate every day. Mm-hmm. And also I play some badminton. Badminton. I'm not learning any of the things that I want to hear. Smile, act drunk and play badminton. What, uh, does badminton really help you? Yeah, it really helps because, you know, I can play anywhere I go. Right. You know, with one people is enough. Right. Not like basketball, you know, you need five people, ten people to play. Right, right. You know? Badminton, you can play anywhere in it. Probably it's a good hand-eye coordination. You can control your body, you know, move. Right, right. Keep your shape. Yeah. Right. That's, that's fascinating. I'm going to start taking up badminton. And then people are going to really beat me up. Well, we mentioned this already, but this movie Unleashed, it's an interesting idea that you are basically someone who is trained. In the movie, your character was never really taught to speak or communicate or have emotions. Your character is just trained to be an attack dog and fight. Yes. And then you end up meeting Morgan Freeman and he tries to help you. But through a good part of the movie, you have to be someone who in, for all intents and purposes, is a vicious, animal. How did you train for that as an actor? How did you prepare? I played more than 30 movies. I always played tough guy. Right. This first time I play, you know, mentally only 10 years old. Right. I mean, the first thing I need to work with the acting coach, forget who Jet Li is. Right. Then I just... Forget Jet Li completely. Yeah. Become this other person. Learning this tennis world. Right. But I stay in this world for seven months. I got very painful, you know. I got very hurt. Right. Afterwards, the whole year I didn't make movies. Because it was such a drain to do this one character that afterwards you decide I'm not going to make a movie for a year. I just have to... Yeah. Very painful. Right. Right. To be that person. And also it must be hard for the people around you. Yes. Because you become these characters and then other people have to... You take it home with you at the end of the day of shooting probably. Yeah. You know, my lawyer, my manager, everybody say, hey Jet, this is the next movie. We want to talk about this. Get out of here. I'm Danny. I'm not Jet Li. I don't want to talk movie business. I only focus on the here. I'm Danny. Right. Right. Well, they live in Hollywood. They're in the industry. I'm sure they know what an attack dog is like. So they'll be fine. But it must be still very weird for them, I would think. You know, for people to be around you when you're in that kind of phase. Yes. Very hard for them. You... When you first came to the United States from China... Yeah. You performed. This is 1974. Is that right? Yes. You performed as part of a show at the White House. And the president was President Nixon at the time. And during that period of time, there were very hostile, cold relationships between the United States and China. When you came to this country and you stayed in a hotel room, they bugged your room. Is that true? Yeah. That's what I heard when I was in China. Right. Because at that time, two countries not very close. They don't understand each other. But I... And so they... I went to the hotel. I tried to say, there's a real bug in there somewhere. I talked to the mirror, talked to flowers. I said, I want chocolate. I want ice cream. You want chocolate? You want ice cream? Yeah, I want a banana. Yeah. So next morning, you know, I go to the demonstration. I go back, open the door. I was shocked. Everything I ordered, I asked. Just really? Really? They got it for you? Well, that's very nice. That must have made you think, well, United States, not so bad. Very good. At least they're... It's like you're a jack-in-the-box. At least they're listening. That's nice. Well, Unleashed opens next Friday. And really, very cool to meet you. I've always really wanted to have you on the show. Me too. So thank you so much for being here. Continue your success. Gently. Let's check in again. We're going to check in with Jose and Dan at the Borgata Hotel in Atlantic City. And I think they've got Sammy Hagar is doing a guest poll for us. There we go. Let's see. What's up? I'm going to win you some money, brother. Nice. All right. Thank you very much. Sammy Hagar, everybody. Yeah. This is getting very, very exciting. All right. Thank you, gently. Jennifer Esposito coming up. We'll take a break. We'll be right back.
