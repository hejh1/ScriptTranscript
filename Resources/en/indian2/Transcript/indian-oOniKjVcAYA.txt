- Well, festive chair has arrived early with the big discount deals on Amazon and Flipkart. Consumers have begun to rush to snack deals on everything from electronics to fashion. Hello and welcome. You are watching the big story on NDTV profit and Amnupur Talwar Suri in the spotlight today is a great Indian battle of e-commerce sales. The upcoming October to December period critical for retailers as festivals from
Devali to Durga Pooja drive up sales, contributing a significant portion of the annual revenue. Consumers are embracing the festive spirit with their proactive shopping behaviour, signalling and even stronger performance ahead. Now leading smartphone brands like Xiaomi and Samsung are capitalising on the moment slashing prices and pushing hard-to-clear stocks while encouraging retailers to meet bold targets. e-commerce heavyweights, Amazon Flipkart,
as well as Mintra along with the rapid delivery services like Blinkit and Zepto are leading the charge rolling out discounts as high as 80% with ultra-fast delivery options. On the big story, we look at who's dominating the e-commerce shopping space. to discuss this further.
We are now joined by Mr. Anil Bharatvaj. He is the Secretary-General of the Federation of SMEs. Mr. Bharatvaj, good evening. Thank you very much for speaking to us on NDTV Profit. Now, Mr. Bharatvaj, of course, this is a time, you know, when big e-commerce wars actually play out in the country, everywhere you look, retailers have been aggressively advertising, they're trying to woo Indian shoppers with discounts. That almost would seem unbelievable, up to 80 percent off, up to 85% off.
Now, we are also looking at revenues worth about one lakh crore this year. How do you see this big battle to capture this space? See, this is a fact of Indian retail industry that almost 40 to 50 percent of sales happen during the festive period. And almost everybody is predisposed to buy, to decorate houses for gifting. So gifting as a matter of fact majority of the gifting takes place during this period.
And sellers have their task cut out. They also want to leverage this predisposition of the clients and the consumers. And they stock goods, they plan, they do their inventory planning, capital management, etc. exactly for this one month and a half or two. So our members also stock stuff and they plan and they try to club many products together and try to push as many as possible.
selling more and based on the quantity they want to reduce the prices and deals come. So some of course may go up to 20%, 30%, 40%. So I mean this is interesting as well as good for consumers. Right now Mr. Bhajwaj, there are a lot of consumers who actually wonder whether these big giants actually first bump up the prices and then
appear to give discounts. And that's the question on a lot of people's minds as to how much discount are you actually getting? Are these discounts for real? - Well, to be honest, India is such a large market and there are so many sellers, hundreds and thousands of sellers both online and offline. It is impossible to manage the prices to be honest. So there is no possibility of bumping up the prices than giving the discounts for this.
these counts are genuine. The difference is that people try to push the inventory because they have stocked it and they have, I mean if you sell more, then there is a possibility that you can reduce the prices. So it's based on that bulk sale that ultimately they have been able to reduce prices. And they also know that if they miss out on this window of a porturity of one month and a half or two, then they will have to wait for next one here. So I think
I think at the end of it, maybe the discounts would be pretty steep in the beginning maybe less, but I guess most of the discounts are real. >> You essentially saying is that it's actually volumes that are driving up these sales and manufacturers are looking at perhaps doing enough volume to be able to gather profits. But you made this point about the first people who hit the sale.
Now there is some research that seems to suggest that the first one week of these sales is actually where you get the best deals and also where retailers actually get the maximum profits. Well, that depends actually from product to product. So I mean it may be different in mobile, it may be different in perfubry products or maybe different in maybe food stuff. So it depends. So I think because of the competition, there are different
different people and they check out their own strategies to market that what suits them most. But there is no method to it actually. So it is basically their own individual market genius that they want to try out. Right. Now what we see in reports that are coming out, it seems to suggest that mobiles and fashion is something that has the biggest piece in the pie. Mobiles, yes smartphones, of everybody's list.
fashion. Do you see this as a growing and a changing trend? Absolutely, for sure. I mean, fashion has entered into gifting, which was not earlier the case. Earlier people used to gift only dry fruits and maybe biscuits and chocolates. Now fashion has entered into it, perfumed in a big way. So I think it is maybe because that you have more choice. The brands are also there, which are more dependable. And the prices are also more stabilized so people are aware that if you buy
I'm not in this season, you might end up paying more. So I think it works out because of the volumes and because of the ease of choice between many brands. - Right, also, the battle also seems to be shifting now to tier two and tier three cities. Earlier, it was just the metros, which essentially contributed to much of the growth that we see in, say, the big guys that's a flip-cart and Amazon. But now we are seeing an interest in the future.
trend that it's also picking up in tier two and tier three cities. Is that something you have noticed as well? Yes, yes, you're right and there are two major drivers for that. One is the connectivity, road connectivity and there is the connectivity of the mobile. So now, even the villages in the remoteest part of India, you have the speed of two MPPS per second, which makes the smartphone works when in the villages and
People can use the apps of major platforms and order them online. And the good thing is that the goods can be delivered at their doorstep because of the better good connectivity. So I think a lot of good things have converged to create new markets in tier two and two, tier two, three cities. - Right now, in the beginning of this game, there were just two major prayers. One of course was split-cart and then there was Amazon. And now we hear almost of new names coming up.
which seems to be picking up at least in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. And there are several others. How do you see this playing out in the longer run?
I think at the top there may be two or three broad-based platforms and then of course there would be niche players, maybe regional players, maybe specializing in certain commodities, maybe specializing delivery on the speed of delivery. So India I think is a very hot market and it is providing opportunities for a lot of innovations to take place. So I think it's good and looking forward I think there are more opportunities for newer players who can serve those customers.
will have remain unsolved till now. All right. Thank you very much for joining us on this discussion. Mr. Bharatvaj, good to have you on the show. Thank you. Pleasure is mine. Thank you. All right.
