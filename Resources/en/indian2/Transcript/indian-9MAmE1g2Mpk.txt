What we now should focus to quick heal, the stock has been a double or a year to date basis and has risen over 10% on a monthly basis as well. Now due to its various product launches, however it's under pressure today, we spoke to the chief executive officer Vishal Selvi about the recent launch of anti-fraud.ai. So this is a completely new category of product that we have launched after three decades in the cyberscurity
industry and having a very flagship product of antivirus, which is what we do see. We have now launched antivirus related product, but this is basically into antifraud and it addresses the issue of the growing problem of frauds that are happening because of growth rapid digitization. And it was the first time actually in three decades at the creating a second category in our B2C.
product. So of course, you know, we have great expectations in terms of how this will be adopted and given that, you know, it is something which is completely new in the Indian market. We know we expect that we will add significant value in terms of protecting customers from falling victims to the growing frauds. Right. But can you just talk to us about how this might add to your revenue top line time or what quarter.
What is this schedule?
it has already started in the sense that we've already started dispatching the inventory to all our partners and resellers and we've had a global and India launch across each of the regions where there has been very good participation from our partners to see the demand that can grow. So for all practical purposes it's already now launched and
and we'll start getting revenues recorded from this quarter onwards. Right, got that. Okay, let me move on to talking about the revenue mix. Your focus gradually has been moving towards enterprise customers from the consumer-based category. For example, it was 20 to 18, F-21, and in the recent quarter, it has been around 43 to 57%. So can you tell us more about how this enterprise business is?
is looking out for you, is it more margin, a creative and why such a kind of shift and what are your future plans? - Prickil has been, you know, pioneers in cybersecurity and anti-virus for many years. It has, it stood the last three decades of innovation and changes which have happened and we have, you know, have a market position in terms of, you know, you know, all the products
and we to see. And in it was natural that we pivot towards enterprise security. And because there's a significant amount of growth in terms of the overall market that is growing as far as enterprise security is concerned. And also, there are so many avenues to create value addition and different solutions which are coming up in the market. So Quikil has created enterprise development.
grant call secure right and in that we have you know different products sets you know in terms of protection detection and prevention and and so we have a host of these solutions that we have introduced in the market and we believe that's where the future growth will lie as far as the company's concern so the investments have been happening for over the past seven or eight years and we are now at a position where we are able to see the benefits of of that growth which is
where you can see that 40% of our revenues are coming from enterprise and it's growing on a quarter basis. Right. Okay. So, let me talk to you about the margins. One doubt which I had is when you move to the B2B business, don't you think you're negotiating power in terms of B2B business will go down because of the competition over there? I think the market is fairly large. describing the problem related to cybersecurity is only increasing.
because of the way in which we are adopting digital, cloud, AI, data, and so many regulations coming in and expectations. Obviously, organizations are facing a significant challenge and there are many organizations who adopted it and there are many more organizations who are yet to adopt it. So I think the market is fairly large. There is still a untapped segment of customers who have not yet adopted cybersecurity in a holistic manner. And you know we are the only
only in India, make in India story, right? Where we argue well for Atmanil Parapara and make in India. And so, you know, in from that point of view, there's a tremendous opportunity for a company like us who have been in the forefront of creating these solutions for many years. And now, you know, really investing in various solutions for enterprise. So we do believe that, you know, have a huge amount of play as far as the
market is concerned. And also I think enterprise business has great margins and also there's a lot of predictability and consistency in terms of collections and other things. So therefore I think it's a business that we believe is going to help us to grow and scale the company to a different level altogether. Right. So as you said that enterprise business is more margin of creative. So can you just be qualified and tomorrows.
of a number? So we have not shared these details publicly and also right now we are on silent period so I won't be able to share much but having said that one of the things which I definitely shared is that we believe and we have seen and observed that the enterprise business gives us better collections, better margins and obviously better scale so it's a
It's definitely an area where we're going to double down. We are investing significantly in innovation. We are one of the largest malware labs in the country. If not in the country, I think it's also in this region as well. And we are doing lots in terms of adding new solutions. So we have already released Horizon 2 products. And now we are in the process of releasing Horizon 3, which is the new tech, new technologies and new solutions which are going to come the future for enterprises.
So what kind of mix do you see going forward for the enterprise and customer do you see like 50/50 or even more from coming from the enterprise? Definitely it's going to be crossing 50 very soon. At the rate at which we are growing, we moved from 2080 to already 4060. And so clearly if you look at the market, 95% to 5% is the split between enterprise and the consumer globally.
So obviously that's a potential that we have in terms of how we can grow and start getting our share. Of course, we are new to people to enterprise security. And so we have a way to go in terms of how we can catch up there. But all the trends that we have seen the last five or six quarters as far as the company is concerned, we are seeing the trajectory where every quarter we are consistently growing our enterprise by our business. And that will continue to happen. We continue to strengthen our Conspicuous and Consumers.
business by and fact that we are now launching a new category of anti fraud which is very different from antivirus is a demonstration that we continue to also focus on our code which is our consumer business. Right, got that very interesting part on how you want to scale up the enterprise business. But let me talk to you about the Microsoft outage which happened recently. So these kind of outerties which happen out there.
do you look at it as an opportunity for you to pitch your solution to the enterprise and the customer or give me some kind of color on how this can pose as an opportunity for you. I think one thing which has the Microsoft CrowdStrike outages highlighted is the widespread importance of cybersecurity solutions in today's digital world, right?
And you can imagine that one product going down can cause such a big impact to the world and the global markets. So obviously, it's a very important responsibility that every vendor just not just a cybersecurity vendor, but any vendor has in terms of making sure that the products are efficient and that working and do not create a denial of service to its customers. Obviously, this incident gives us Uh...
the importance of how it updates the software updates that you release on your endpoints. I'm critically to be tested properly before it is released to the market. So clearly, this is one example of how something can go wrong and if the world should know about it, we can happen to anyone so we don't want to just say that and criticize it.
I think we can learn from this. At the same time, we are extremely proud and happy to say that, you know, PICHEL, the history has never faced such a challenge. We obviously managed 9 million endpoints across the globe. And we have never had a blue screen of that kind of an issue for so many years. And so we have a very robust testing methodology and how we do it. And we will continue to do that. We obviously always look at opportunities
can our products can add value to our customers. And we are seeing a strong uptake, as far as that is concerned in the Indian context right now for enterprise business. And obviously every situation creates an opportunity for us. And in this case, our customers were happy that they never faced this problem because they were using our software. - Right, got that. Very interesting. Of course, customers would now be more aware on how software is important.
software security is important. But one last question because of crunch of time, Quikil has done immensely well given more than 150% return in last one year. But I would want to know what are your modes that you're looking forward to in the near-term at least for the next three to four quarters for our viewers? I think we have done since the time it's been now just about a year that I've come on board as a CEO of QUICEL and some of the changes that
we are doing is in terms of strengthening our leadership. So we have hired various leaders from different parts of the industry and we are happy that we have been able to attract them and it is giving us a clear momentum in terms of what how we want to execute our strategy as far as the sales is concerned. We are kind of re-energizing and re-entering our sales motion nice for the center place, it's just constantly.
And so there's a significant amount of, you know, addition in not just in the senior, but mid-management level, you know, as far as our sales, the enterprise sales is concerned. And the third is I think, you know, we kind of committed to, you know, our product roadmap. And, you know, Quikhil has been at the center of innovation. We have nine patents across cybersecurity, which, you know, not many people are aware of.
and extremely proud of Indian company having nine cybersecurity patents. And so the foundation of our company is innovation. And the malware lab that I talked about having 100-plus researchers were then there looking at what's happening around the world in threat landscapes. So we're kind of looking at how deep we can go in terms of and how we can monetize some of the knowledge that we have, which is very critical for today's world.
in terms of disseminating that information and using that information to protect our customers and then infrastructure from attacks. So that's what we are doing in terms of making sure that we have a clear roadmap of current as well as future and we're investing all our profits into that innovation and R&D. We are going to invest significantly in sales and making sure that we have a good leadership team.
to try that and driving the talent and city of the organization. So these are some of the very important pivot which are and we are going so well so far you know that and we have a very long term view in terms of how we want to grow the organization.
