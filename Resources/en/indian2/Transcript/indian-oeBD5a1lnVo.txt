Abhi Shuru, yes, other time in UI is going to be going on. In fact, even I didn't know about the company. So these are like, you know, one to 100 type of companies. If you want to start a big business, they will run like anything. And if they, correct, then they can go to zero. Hi guys, welcome to today's video. So on today's video, I'm going to speak about Indian artificial intelligence talks. Now, most of my bits or AI-driven bits are in the US. Now, this is something that I had done earlier. I'm already sitting on very good profits on those bits. And those companies were easy to identify because they were working on mega
trends, mega themes, for example, like data libraries, for artificial intelligence. Now many companies were working on that aspect. So picking those stocks was much easier. But I got a very interesting question from my community member and he asked me that, "Hey Akshat, okay fine, you have picked like AI driven stocks in the US, but India may be the work on AI. For a very long period of time I avoided picking like Indian companies or Indian AI driven stocks, but I am warming up to the idea that, you know, India may be the, but there is is a type of an AI work that will happen in India.
So on this video I'm going to help you understand what type of AI work will be done in India. Why is that such an important industry and how do you analyze stocks on Indian AI? So I'll pick a case study, I'll help you understand the entire thematics around it. AI stocks are very complicated to understand. So I'll try to simplify the tech as much as possible. So I'll try to make the language very easy to understand. So let us first and foremost understand that AI are not just a hava, right? right here I mean AI everyone is talking about AI Rali Rali be over AI so by the
So, when you get it will be like some kind of pump and dump. See guys, I mean, I don't know whether it will be pump and dump or it will not be pump and dump. It's a tech. It is still one of the prominent techs even Apple iPhone 16 to be launched with. Us may be the entire marketing was done around AI that it was an AI driven phone. Now is it really like practically being applied not practically being applied. That's a separate matter of debate. But the larger point here is that even Apple is playing that AI card. Similarly, if you check the newest release by Meta, even that is playing the AI
So, therefore, AI as a technology is here to stay. Some of the best AI stocks, if you want to do like broad based investing, they will be in the US. But there are certain themes which will be aligned in India because of a very sensible thing called as data security risk.
India, these are the type of companies I might be willing to put some money on. So let us understand and there are essentially six, seven key criteria that I will tell you in terms of analyzing any AI stock. Whichever examples I'm using on this video, please use it as a case study. It's not as if that I have built my position in these. I'm just using it as a reference point to tell you how to analyze the stocks. So because I'm going to go to the stock, then you can use this framework to analyze it. So let me explain and the seven key concepts. I'll just explain. The first key concept is very simple and it is called
the concept of innovation curve. So innovation curve means that this is how the innovation works. First you will see that nothing is happening. Any new technology comes for example internet in the 90s. Which casthani there was hardly any application of internet in the 90s right and for close to a decade nothing major happened.
Then again there will be dullness. So this is called as S curve innovation. Okay. Now the thing is that whenever we hear these type of trendy things, EV, AI, AI, your generative AI, so we get like very excited and whatever companies we are getting our hands on, we end up purchasing them. Now is that the right way of investing? The short answer is no. Basically your goal should be to wait it out. Look for the fact that whether the technology is getting mature or are we actually using it and then build your positions, that's what any smart investor would be to do.
So, first is the concept of S-curve, you should be very clear about this. Now the second key concept is to understand the spectrum of the AI. For example, say meta-i, now it is doing different type of work. Google it, it is doing different type of work. If you are looking at Microsoft, it is doing different type of work within the AI spectrum. Now some of these spectrums might be mature. Some of these spectrums might not be mature. For example, just a data library generate curve 9. That's common sense that whichever company controls the data libraries, its AI model will be stronger right?
because it will be able to create more sophisticated AI models based on that data library. Now this is a very clear first principle type of thinking that you can apply in order to pick stocks. Now in India if you have to pick the issue is that we are not working or the Indian companies are not working on like big big ideas so to say. Here we have to pick sensible sub segments in India in the AI space which will get evolved first. So this is the most important learning that I will say that you have to pick the right spectrum of AI stocks to begin with. Now, we will meet in such a company.
is like trying to compete with Google. I don't think that you know that is a feasible solution or that company will be able to progress much. It will be a much harder bet compared to companies which are doing very niche work. So therefore the second concept that you need to understand the spectrum of AI is very very critical. So let me start talking about a company as a case study and tell you how you can figure out which spectrum is that particular company working on. So for example, here a company is called as Blue Cloud Soft Tech solution. If you are in the screener, you will find a lot of information.
data on this company except for like annual report. And in fact any AI company that you pick in India right now, it will be like a small pair. For example, this company has a market cap of 3,500 crores. So this is a small cap company, a small cap company, a new company, a working in some innovative thing. So you'll not find like a lot of data around it. So what I've done is I've prepared a note for this company in case you guys want to research more, you can use that note to get and gather more data. Please consider it as a data gathering exercise. And you can put the stock on a radar,
then you can figure out whether to invest not invest all that stuff. So basically if you go and Google about this company, read more information about this company, there are certain data things that you will get. But the first critical data point that you need to aggregate is, give me a calm kiss make a re here. For example, if you go and learn more about blue cloud soft tech solutions, what you will will notice that new cloud software is running.
And within AI also they are focusing on two areas. One is cyber security products and second is healthcare based processes. In fact, if you are all interested in this, you can find the link in the description.
So just to help you understand that any AI stock that you pick at India right now, basically what you need to do on that is that you need to understand the spectrum of AI where it is working. For example, this particular company is working on cyber security. Number two, it is working in the healthcare space using AI for diagnostics. Then the third key point that you need to investigate about a company is, and again, going back to the concept of S curve, you know, S curve is very much a very good one, right? That the company has to burn a lot of money in order to prove that technology, get to a scale, all that.
1 to 100 type of companies. If it is a big start, they will run like anything and if they correct, then they can go to zero. So there is always this type of a risk. So therefore it is important for you to check the current balance sheet of the company
investigate more about this company. So, in that respect, I had picked it up. So, from this, you can see is that the company is making money. It is profitable and it is pivoting to the right set of AI which could gain traction in India. Now, why am I saying that something like healthcare or cyber security can get traction in India? Reason was simple. For example, cyber security is a work area where foreign intervention is typically not allowed. So, you have to need homegrown AI based companies. Similarly, when it comes to health oriented data. Now health is again a very
critical data point for any country and half the aggregation of data. So again, this need to be indigenized. Indigenized means that we want homegrown Indian companies to be in these critical sectors. So if a company is working on these critical sectors, then automatically there is a little bit of advantage there. But if you are competing on social media based AI, right? Yeah, when you create content, right? And all that stuff by using AI. And honestly, like this is not a company that will find any protection within India and those type of businesses might not be
Indigeneized. Now the fourth thing that you need to analyze in terms of any company is the regulation risk. For example, if it is a cybersecurity based AI company or it is working in critical segments or critical sectors like healthcare, then the chances of regulation are high. Now this is a risk that we are taking in case you are considering investing in these type of companies. So, this is definitely a risk and you should be cognizant of it. But if we step back and take a larger picture, then the entire AI space will be put under a certain policy consideration and there will be a certain
that will be generated and this framework also needs to be constantly updated right now. Because AI is evolving at such a fast pace that it is very difficult to keep a track. But regulation is one area which we cannot be sure of, in case we get the regulation. But AI, almost every single AI company out there will be regulated and that is definitely a risk. But if we take a step back and consider then almost every single country on earth right now is understanding the power of AI and they want to promote AI. So, the chances are that hildier regulations will be built for
here and this is always a chance that you have to take with tech companies. Then come point number five which is the concentration risk. For example when we go to tech based companies like Microsoft, Amazon etc. you will quickly find out that they have diversified their geographical risk a lot. For example, first from America, American customers started selling a lot in India. So they have been able to diversify their risk in terms of their customer base and also on top of that their product line extension.
the AI space in India would have like a flagship product. So it's important for you to understand how that app exactly works, how that product exactly works, what is the mode of that product. So understanding that mode is very critical. So it's a app manate download and these are the type of data sets that I was able to find. Now the final point of analysis that you need to keep in mind is the mode analysis or the competitive advantage of the company. Now the thing is that because AI is a very new area, the companies that mode by on the
mode, but when it comes to small or mid cap AI based stocks in India, they have no more right now. They are trying to build their brand. They are trying to figure out that product market fit. So, as a massive mode, this is a chance that you are taking. So, in case you are investing in these type of companies or any AI stock right now in India, almost all of them are at a nascent stage. They are experimenting with their product line. What you need to do is that you need to look at all these four or five key points that I have have spoken about, figure out industries where AI will be.
