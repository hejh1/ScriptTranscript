अभी शुरू ही है, जाधा टाइम भी नहीं हुआ इसको In fact, even I did not know about the company So, these are like, you know, 1-100 type of companies क्यार ये बढ़ना शुरू होंगी, तो they will run like anything And if they are correct, then they can go to zero Hi guys, welcome to today's video So, on today's video, I am going to speak about Indian Artificial Intelligence stocks Now, most of my bets or AI driven bets are in the US Now, this is something that I had done earlier I am already sitting on very good profits on those bets And those companies were easy to identify Because they were working on like, you know, mega trends, mega themes For example, like there are data libraries for Artificial Intelligence Now, many companies were working on that aspect So, picking those stocks was much easier But I got a very interesting question from my community member And he asked me that, hey, Akshat, okay fine, you have picked like AI driven stocks in the US But even in India, there will be work on AI For a very long period of time, I avoided picking like Indian companies or Indian AI driven stocks But I am warming up to the idea that, you know, it will be in India too But there is a type of an AI work that will happen in India So, on this video, I am going to help you understand what type of AI work will be done in India Why is that such an important industry? And how do you analyze stocks on Indian AI? So, I will pick a case study I will help you understand the entire thematics around it AI stocks are very complicated to understand So, I will try to simplify the tech as much as possible So, I will try to make the language very easy to understand So, let us first and foremost understand that AI is not a game I mean, AI, everyone is talking about AI There has been a rally on AI So, it is not like it will be like some kind of pump and dump See guys, I mean, I don't know whether it will be pump and dump or it will not be pump and dump It is a tech, it is still one of the prominent techs Even Apple, when iPhone 16 was launched In that too, the entire marketing was done around AI That it was an AI driven phone Now, is it really like practically being applied, not practically being applied? That's a separate matter of debate The larger point here is that even Apple is playing that AI card Similarly, if you check the newest release by Meta Even that is playing the AI card So, therefore, AI as a technology is here to stay Some of the best AI stocks, if you want to do like broad based investing They will be in the US But there are certain themes which will be aligned in India Because of a very sensible thing called as data security risk For example, there are cyber security based AI companies Or there are healthcare based AI companies Now, these are very sensitive data sets And if you start inviting like American companies to do like AI work on these domains Then it could be a problem, right? So, therefore, these type of companies, if I am able to figure out in India These are the type of companies I might be willing to put some money on So, let us understand And there are essentially 6-7 key criteria that I will tell you In terms of analyzing any AI stock Whichever examples I am using on this video, please use it as a case study It's not as if that I have built my position in these I am just using it as a reference point to tell you how to analyze the stocks So, if any stock comes in front of you, then you can use this framework to analyze it So, let me explain And the 7 key concepts, I will just explain The first key concept is very simple And it is called as the concept of innovation curve So, innovation curve means that basically this is how the innovation works First, you will see that nothing is happening I mean, any new technology comes, for example, internet in the 90s There was hardly any application of internet in the 90s, right? And for close to a decade, nothing major happened Then suddenly, so many new companies came in like Yahoo came in Bunch of like streaming platforms, audio streaming, video streaming platform came in And there was a lot of innovation, right? Then again, there was like dullness, right? And then again, there was like massive innovation Then again, there will be dullness So, this is called as S-curve innovation, okay? Now, the thing is that whenever we hear these type of trendy things like EV has come, AI has come Or generative AI has come So, we get like very excited And whatever companies we are getting our hands on, we end up purchasing them Now, is that the right way of investing? The short answer is no Basically, your goal should be to wait it out Look for the fact that whether the technology is getting mature Are we actually using it? And then build your positions That's what any smart investor would be doing, right? So, first is the concept of S-curve You should be very clear about this Now, the second key concept is to understand the spectrum of the AI For example, like Meta AI Now, it is doing different type of work It is Google, it is doing different type of work If you are looking at Microsoft, it is doing different type of work within the AI spectrum Now, some of these spectrums might be mature Some of these spectrums might not be mature For example, like we have to generate data libraries That's commonsensical that whichever company controls the data libraries Its AI model will be stronger, right? Why? Because it will be able to create more sophisticated AI models Based on that data library Now, this is a very clear first principles type of thinking That you can apply in order to pick stocks Now, in India if you have to pick The issue is that we are not working Or the Indian companies are not working on like big big ideas, so to say Here we have to pick sensible sub-segments in India In the AI space which will get evolved first Okay, so this is the most important learning that I will say That you have to pick the right spectrum of AI stocks to begin with Now, if you get such a company in India Which is like trying to compete with Google I don't think that you know that is a feasible solution Or that company will be able to progress much It will be a much harder bet Compared to companies which are doing very niche work So, therefore the second concept That you need to understand the spectrum of AI Is very very critical So, let me start talking about a company as a case study And tell you how you can figure out Which spectrum is that particular company working on So, for example here is a company It is called as Blue Cloud Soft Tech Solution If you go to the screener and see the data You will not find a lot of data on this company Except for like annual report And in fact any AI company that you pick in India right now It will be like a small pair For example, this company has a market cap of 3,500 crores So, this is a small cap company It is a new company and working in some innovative thing So, you will not find a lot of data around it So, what I have done is I have prepared a note for this company In case you guys want to research more You can use that note to get and gather more data Please consider it as a data gathering exercise And you can put the stock on a radar Observe it for a while And then you can figure out whether to invest or not So, basically if you go and Google about this company Read more information about this company There are certain data things that you will get But the first critical data point that you need to aggregate is What is this company doing? For example, if you go and learn more about Blue Cloud Soft Tech Solutions What you will notice is that Blue Cloud Soft Tech Solutions Is a leading IT solutions provider Till now it used to work on IT And it used to specialize on all these things And now it has started to pivot to AI based applications And within AI also They are focusing on two areas One is cyber security products And second is healthcare based processes In fact, if you read more in-depth You will get to know that This company has launched An app And it is called as True Health App So, basically what it does is It does non-intrusive medical diagnostics Using AI computer vision technology And it is working on this technology And it has already started making some money from this So, which is an innovative thing That this company is doing So, to help you understand that any AI stock That you pick in India right now Basically what you need to do on that is That you need to understand the spectrum of AI Where it is working For example, this particular company is working on cyber security Number two, it is working in the healthcare space Using AI for diagnostics Then the third key point that you need to investigate About a company is Going back to the concept of S-curve That the company has to burn a lot of money In order to prove that technology Get to a scale So, these are like you know 1-100 type of companies They will run like anything And if they are correct, then they can go to zero So, there is always this type of a risk So, therefore it is important for you to check the current balance sheet Of the company and figure out Whether the company can make money Or does it have the history of making money or not So, for example, you will see here Is it a profitable company? Yes, it is a profitable company It is a small cap, there is no big profit It has just started, there is not much time In fact, even I did not know about the company So, a student of mine messaged me Can you investigate more about this company? So, in that respect, I picked it up So, from this you can see that the company Is making money, it is profitable And it is pivoting to the right set of AI Which could gain traction in India Now, why am I saying that Something like healthcare or Cyber security can get traction in India Reason is very simple For example, cyber security is a work area Where foreign intervention is typically not allowed So, here you need homegrown AI based companies Similarly, when it comes to health oriented data Now, health is again a very critical data point For any country And if aggregation of data is happening here So, again this need to be indigenized Indigenized means that We want homegrown Indian companies to be in these critical sectors So, if a company is Working on these critical sectors Then automatically there is a little bit of advantage there But if you are competing on Social media based AI How do you create content and all that stuff By using AI Honestly, this is not a company that will find any protection Within India and those type of businesses Might not be indigenized Now, the fourth thing that you need to analyze In terms of any company is the regulation risk For example, if it is a cyber security based AI company Or it is working in critical segments Or critical sectors like healthcare Then the chances of regulation are high Now, this is a risk that we are taking In case you are considering investing in these type of companies So, this is definitely a risk But if we step back And take a larger picture Then the entire AI space will be put under A certain policy consideration And there will be a certain framework that will be generated And this framework also needs to be Constantly updated right now Because AI is evolving at such a fast pace That it is very difficult to keep a track But regulation is one area Which we cannot be sure of What type of regulations will come in this But AI, almost every single AI company out there Will be regulated and that is definitely a risk But if we take a step back and consider Then almost every single country on earth Right now is understanding The power of AI and they want to promote AI So, the chances are that healthier regulations Will be built for AI and this is always A chance that you have to take with tech companies Then comes point number 5 Which is the concentration risk For example, when we go to tech based companies Like Microsoft, Amazon, etc You will quickly find out That they have diversified their geographical risk A lot. For example, They started selling to American customers So, what you have to do is You have to look at the business model of the company Again, it's free notes This is just like data compilation that my team has done And you can go here and see And I will show you two things If you look at the overall financials You will see that their total income is increasing So, there seems to be no issues here per se But the second and more important point that I wanted to highlight That within the AI space They are looking at these type of proprietary products Right? And about these products It's very important that you google them Read them a little Because every company that is getting into the AI space in India Would have like a flagship product So, it's important for you to understand How that app exactly works How that product exactly works What is the moat of that product So, understanding that moat is very critical So, I downloaded it and saw And these are the type of data sets that I was able to find Now, the final point of analysis that you need to keep in mind Is the moat analysis Or the competitive advantage of the company Now, the thing is that because AI is a very new area Companies haven't started making moats yet For example, okay You can understand the moat of Amazon, Meta In a way But when it comes to small or mid-cap AI based stocks in India They have no moat right now They are trying to build their brand They are trying to figure out that product market fit So, you won't see a massive moat This is a chance that you are taking So, in case you are investing in these type of companies Or any AI stock right now in India Almost all of them are at a nascent stage They are experimenting with their product line What you need to do is That you need to look at all these 4-5 key points That I have spoken about Figure out industries where AI will find its product market fit in India That it will work there For example, there are a lot of chances of healthcare based AI working there Similarly, There are a lot of chances of cyber security based AI working there So, these are good industries to pick Or good sub-segments to pick In this, look at how good the product of a company is Mix of all these points Will give you the eventual moat And hopefully if you are able to create a basket Of these type of 4-5 good AI based stocks Which are in the small-cap, mid-cap category Then these will be the type of next TCS or Infosys type of companies So, I hope that you found this short video to be insightful If you did, do press the like button And I will see you soon Thank you
