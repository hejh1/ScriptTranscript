In fact, even I did not know about the company. These are like 1-100 type of companies. They will run like anything. If they are correct, then they can go to zero.

Hi, guys. Welcome to today's video. In today's video, I'm going to speak about Indian Artificial Intelligence stocks. Most of my bets or AI-driven bets are in the US. This is something that I had done earlier, and I'm already sitting on very good profits on those bets. Those companies were easy to identify because they were working on mega trends, mega themes. For example, there are data libraries for artificial intelligence. Many companies are working on that aspect. Picking those stocks was much easier. 

But I got a very interesting question from a community member, and he asked me, "Hey, Akshat, okay, fine. You have picked AI-driven stocks in the US, but India may be the come-over on AI." For a very long period of time, I avoided picking Indian companies or Indian AI-driven stocks. But I'm warming up to the idea that India may be the place where AI work will happen. In this video, I'm going to help you understand what type of AI work will be done in India, why it is such an important industry, and how to analyze stocks in Indian AI. I'll pick a case study and help you understand the entire thematics around it. AI stocks are very complicated to understand, so I'll try to simplify the tech as much as possible and make the language very easy to understand. 

Let us first and foremost understand that AI is not a rally value on AI. See, guys, I don't know whether it will be a pump and dump or it will not be a pump and dump. It is still one of the prominent technologies. Even Apple iPhone 16, when launched, had its entire marketing done around AI, stating it was an AI-driven phone. Now, is it really practically being applied? That's a separate matter of debate. But the larger point here is that even Apple is playing that AI card. Similarly, if you check the newest release by Meta, even that is playing the AI card. Therefore, AI as a technology is here to stay. Some of the best AI stocks, if you want to do broad-based investing, will be in the US. But there are certain themes that will be aligned in India because of a very sensible thing called data security risk. 

For example, cybersecurity-based AI companies or healthcare-based AI companies are working with very sensitive data sets. If you start inviting American companies to do AI work in these domains, it could be a problem. Therefore, if I'm able to figure out these types of companies in India, these are the types of companies I might be willing to put some money on. 

Let us understand that there are essentially six or seven key criteria that I will tell you in terms of analyzing any AI stock. Whichever example I'm using in this video, please use it as a case study. It's not as if I have built my position in these; I'm just using them as reference points to tell you how to analyze the stocks. You can use this framework to analyze them. 

Let me explain the seven key concepts. The first key concept is very simple and is called the concept of the Innovation Curve. The Innovation Curve means this is how innovation works. First, you will see that nothing is happening. Any new technology comes, for example, the Internet in the '90s. There was hardly any application of the Internet in the '90s. For close to a decade, nothing major happened. Then suddenly, so many new companies came in, like Yahoo, a bunch of streaming platforms, audio streaming, and video streaming platforms emerged, leading to a lot of innovation. Then again, there was dullness. Then again, there was massive innovation, followed by another phase of dullness. This is called S-curve innovation. 

Now, the thing is that whenever we hear about trendy things like EV, AI, or generative AI, we get very excited. We end up purchasing whatever companies we can get our hands on. Now, is that the right way of investing? The short answer is no. Your goal should be to wait it out, look for the fact that whether the technology is getting mature, are we actually using it, and then build your positions. That's what any smart investor would do. So first is the concept of the S-curve. You should be very clear about this.

Now, the second key concept is to understand the spectrum of AI. For example, different companies are doing different types of work. Google is doing one type of work, and Microsoft is doing a different type of work within the AI spectrum. Some of these spectrums might be mature, while others might not be mature. For example, just the data libraries. It's commonsensical that whichever company controls the data libraries, its AI model will be stronger. Why? Because it will be able to create more sophisticated AI models based on that data library. This is very clear first principles thinking that you can apply to pick stocks. 

In India, if you have to pick, the issue is that Indian companies are not working on big ideas, so to say. Here, we have to pick sensible subsegments in India in the AI space that will evolve first. This is the most important lesson that I will share: you have to pick the right spectrum of AI stocks to begin with. Trying to compete with Google is not a feasible solution; that company will not progress much compared to companies doing very niche work. Therefore, the second concept of understanding the spectrum of AI is very critical.

Let me start talking about a company as a case study and tell you how you can figure out which spectrum that particular company is working on. For example, here is a company called Blue Cloud SoftTech Solutions. If you look at it in a screener and examine the data, you will not find a lot of information on this company except for its annual report. In fact, any AI company that you pick in India right now will be a small-cap company. For example, this company has a market cap of 3,500 crores. A small-cap company, a new company, is working on some innovative things, so you'll not find a lot of data around it. What I've done is prepare a note for this company. In case you want to research more, you can use that note to gather more data. Please consider it a data-gathering exercise. You can put the stock on a radar, observe it for a while, and then decide whether to invest or not. 

If you Google this company and read more information about it, you will find certain data points. The first critical data point that you need to aggregate is this: Blue Cloud SoftTech Solutions is a leading IT solution provider. It used to specialize in various areas, and now it has started to pivot to AI-based applications. Within AI, they are focusing on two areas: one is cybersecurity products, and the second is healthcare-based processes. In fact, if you read more in-depth, you will find that this company has launched an app called the True Health app. It utilizes non-intrusive medical diagnostics using AI computer vision technology, and it has already started making some money from this, which is an innovative move for this company. 

To help you understand, any AI stock that you pick in India right now requires you to understand the spectrum of AI where it operates. For example, this particular company is working on cybersecurity. Number two, it is working in the healthcare space, using AI for diagnostics. The third key point that you need to investigate about a company is, again, going back to the concept of the S-curve. The company has to burn a lot of money to prove that technology, achieve scale, and so on. These are like 1-100 type of companies. If they are correct, they can go to zero. There is always this type of risk. Therefore, it is important for you to check the current balance sheet of the company and determine whether it can make money. 

For example, is it a profitable company? Yes, it is a profitable company. It is a small cap, but it is not making a big profit. In fact, even I did not know about the company until a student of mine messaged me to investigate it further. From this, you can see that the company is making money, is profitable, and is pivoting to the right areas of AI that could gain traction in India. 

Now, why am I saying that something like healthcare or cybersecurity can gain traction in India? The reason is quite simple. Cybersecurity is an area where foreign intervention is typically not allowed. Here, you need homegrown AI-based companies. Similarly, when it comes to health-oriented data, health is a very critical data point for any country. We want homegrown Indian companies to be in these critical sectors. If a company is working in these critical sectors, then automatically, there is a bit of an advantage. 

However, if you are competing in social media-based AI, those companies might not find any protection within India. Those types of businesses might not be indigenized. The fourth thing that you need to analyze for any company is the regulatory risk. For example, if it is a cybersecurity-based AI company or is working in critical segments like healthcare, the chances of regulation are high. This is a risk we take if you are considering investing in these types of companies. You should be cognizant of it. 

But if we step back and take a larger picture, the entire AI space will be subjected to certain policy considerations, and a framework for AI will be generated. This framework needs to be constantly updated since AI is evolving at such a fast pace; it is very difficult to keep track. Regulation is one area we cannot be sure of. Almost every single AI company will be regulated, and that is definitely a risk. However, if we take a step back and consider, almost every single country on Earth is recognizing the power of AI and wants to promote it. The chances are that healthier regulations will be developed for AI, and this is a chance you have to take with tech companies.

Then comes point number five, which is the concentration risk. For example, with tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and others, you will quickly find out that they have diversified their geographical risk a lot. They have expanded into markets like China and India. They have effectively diversified their risk in terms of customer base and also their product line extensions. So you have to look at the business model of the company. 

Again, this is just data compilation that my team has done. I will show you two things. The first thing is that if you look at the overall financials, there seem to be no issues here, per se. The second and more important point that I wanted to highlight is that within the AI space, they are looking at proprietary products. In products, it's very important that you Google them because every company entering the AI space in India would have a flagship product. Understanding how that app or product works and its moat is very critical. 

Now, the final point of analysis you need to keep in mind is the moat analysis or the competitive advantage of the company. Because AI is a very new area, for example, Amazon, Meta, and others are more recognizable. But when it comes to small or mid-cap AI-based stocks in India, they currently have no moat. They are trying to build their brand and figure out product-market fit. You can see a massive moat, which is a risk you take. 

If you are investing in these types of companies or any AI stock in India right now, almost all of them are at a nascent stage. They are experimenting with their product lines. What you need to do is look at the four or five key points that I have discussed. Figure out industries where AI will find its product-market fit in India. For example, healthcare-based AI has very high chances, and similarly, cybersecurity-based AI also has high potential. These are good industries or subsegments to pick. 

It may look at how good the product of a company is. A mix of all these points will give you the eventual moat. Hopefully, if you can create a basket of these types of 4-5 good AI-based stocks in the small-cap or mid-cap category, then these could be the next TCS or Infosys-type companies.
