"Let's go across now to someone who knows the workings of the Tata Group very well and has known Ratan Tata closely. Soel Say, founder and managing partner at Council AG India, is with us now. Soel, thank you for taking out the time and speaking with us here at NDTV Profit. You know, it's a bit of a poignant conversation because till 24 hours ago we were all talking about a loss, which in a way so many people felt personally, even if they didn't know Mr. Ratan Tata. But everyone felt like they lost something, and today we're talking about what’s next. I suppose such is life.

But give us a sense, is this something that was always on the cards? Because it's been done very smoothly, without any fuss, in a very short period of time. As you said, and you alluded to the church and state, which by the way I'm glad you did—it's a long-forgotten analogy—this was very clear. It was also equally clear to everyone, excuse me, that the transition would be smooth, respectful, and dignified, much like Ratan led his life. 

Much like I can tell you, I've known Noel for years, and there is no one better than Noel Tata to take over from those gigantic shoes for three reasons. One is he understands the workings of the Tata Group because he's worked in the Tata Group for ages, unlike any of the other trustees who are there today. Melly Mistry, to my mind, is the only other person who has been close to Ratan Tata and who has seen the group evolve.

Noel Tata, to my mind, taking over ensures two things. As your colleague was also saying, Tata Sons has been led formidably by N. Chandrasekaran, and everyone should know that Ratan was relieved when N. Chandrasekaran took over as chairman of Tata Sons. His relief was vindicated and continues to be vindicated in the performance of Tata. That separation was needed and was made in 2022, and today you've seen it's smooth, dignified, and swift because the trusts are what the business of Tata was all about. The founders created this enterprise only with a view of giving back to society for the greater good, as was often said when Jamsetji Tata began.

Then Ratan took over, it was very clear that they were in the business of serving humanity, of serving society. I’m delighted, and you know, I just sent Noel a message, then I spoke to him. I said, you know, the beauty is that Ratan will be smiling from the heavens because you’ll have done exactly what he would have wanted you to do. You have done it with grace, you have done it with a sense of continuity, and an even greater commitment to purpose. What better way could there have been?

So, you of course did the last very detailed interview with Ratan Tata as well. Is this something that he always had in mind, that Noel would take over this role? Let me tell you one thing about Mr. Tata: I never ever discussed it with him, but I knew it was coming the day Noel was appointed as trustee on the two major trusts. Let me also say the children, whether it is Neville, Leah, or Maya, are an imprint of the Tata family and the Tata way of life.

So when even the kids got on, I mean, in my heart I knew. After Noel and the kids got on, I did tell Mr. Tata, I said, it's such a great thing that there will be continuity, that there’ll be people who will be happy. You know, remember, all said and done, I’m delighted that there’s a Tata at the head. I'm totally delighted. I'm not communal or a discriminator, but I think it's a good thing because even in Noel, you have decency, you have grace. 

Noel has been extremely committed all his life. He's been low-key, and all the people who said, 'Oh, but Noel is running this today; see where Zudio is. Oh yes, where Trent is; see where Tata Retail is.' It says a lot about character when you succeed and embrace success with grace, with dignity, and with some quietude. To my mind, I’m delighted. On the one hand, I'm deeply sad about what happened and how we've lost, to my mind, a giant of a man. On the other, I'm delighted because I know he too will be wherever he is, and he'll heave a sigh of relief. 

I'm sure even Chandrasekaran, who, as I said, has done a formidable job of leading Tata Sons, he too will be happy because what would Chandra want? He would want the dividend that Tata Sons goes out to a trust which is headed by a human being who will ensure the benefits are provided in multifarious ways to society at large. 

So, do you think Noel will be able to push the philanthropy much more aggressively through the society Mr. Tata has created? Many institutions have been established over the last two decades. Do you see Noel also going that path and creating new institutions for society? Absolutely. And you know, I wouldn't use the word aggressive because that is not part of the lexicon in the Tata way of life. But he will do it. Please remember when Noel started out, everyone doubted, 'Oh, will the build retail do this?' He's done it, he's done it with aplomb, he's taken the footprint globally.

Also remember that with Tata International, he was already the global face of the House of Tata way before. You know the fact that he's Vice Chairman of Tata Steel, he's on the board of Titan, means that he's intricately involved with the running of some of the operating companies of Tata Sons. So I don't think the word is aggressive. What had happened was, and this is an important message for your viewers also to know, that at one point in time, Tata Trust had begun to do a lot of things, and what Mr. Tata did was he assimilated all of that. He then made it pretty coordinated, driven through verticals, and those are continuing to do work, and they're doing amazing work.

For instance, Noel is as committed to cancer centers as Mr. Tata was, as Ratan was. So I see absolutely not even a blip in the manner that this whole thing has happened, and I can tell you it's good for the House of Tata. It's even better for our country. Just on that part, Noel Tata's commitment to some of the same causes that the Tata Trust has taken forward and that Ratan was committed to, such as the Cancer Trust—what are his own sort of very near and dear issues? For example, Mr. Ratan was very passionate about animal rights and has worked towards things like that. 

Is there something, to your knowledge, that Noel would want to focus on in the philanthropic scale while, of course, continuing all the good work that's taking place? I think Noel, if you know him as I do, is a very strategic human being. He is going to be as committed to the small animals hospital and to animal welfare as Ratan Tata was. To expect a carbon copy would be unfair on both Mr. Tata and on Noel.

Please remember that Noel was part of the trust when many of these decisions that you are talking about came to fruition. So I don't see any departure. I can only tell you one thing, Tam, that with Noel there, with Melly there—Noel being the half-brother, being a Tata, and Melly being the person who was the closest confidant of Ratan—I see continuity. I see the same level of commitment rather than the word aggression, and I see the same level and exactitude in terms of purpose.

I know it sounds a little intrusive, Soel, but believe me, people are very curious about this private family. That's why I'm asking about the kind of relationship equation between Ratan Tata and Noel Tata. Did they work together often? How would it work? It was good. I mean, there are people who will cast dispersions on everyone. I mean, even your family, my family, oh, do you talk to your brother? When was the last time you had dinner with him? All that kind of nonsense. But they were together, and let me tell you, Ratan was deeply, deeply fond of Noel's children as well, whether it was Leah, Maya, or Neville. He took to Neville like you can't imagine.

You know, sometimes I used to joke, in fact, at times I would joke to Noel that, you know what, if Ratan skips a generation? Just jokingly—that was the buzz. It's funny you say that, but that was the buzz. It's utter rubbish, let me tell you. Ratan Tata loved Noel deeply. Did he have some issues? He may have, but he never shared them with anyone. Anyone who tells you, 'Oh, Mr. Tata told me that he had this issue or that issue,' is lying because Mr. Tata wasn't that kind of person. He wasn't a gossip producer; he wasn't the kind of person to say, 'Oh, but I don't agree with him,' blah, blah, blah.

Let's not forget, and I don't know if you remember, after October 24, 2016, when Cyrus was asked to resign, he didn't. He was thrown out. There were EGMs held in all the operating companies; there was also an EGM held for Tata Sons. And guess who spoke in the most vociferously organized, committed manner? Noel Tata. Noel spoke against the value desecration and the value degradation that had happened at the House of Tata by his own brother-in-law. Give the man some credit. Noel Tata could have easily just kept quiet, but that's why I'm telling you the same seeds of a principled approach, of firmness, of courage are in Noel as they were in Ratan.

What about the working relationship between Noel Tata and N. Chandrasekaran? Of course, they already work together, but now in this capacity again, excellent. I was there yesterday at NCPA; you should have seen the way Chandrasekaran and Noel were. You know, I’m from theater; I've done 167 plays, Tam. I know a thing or two about body language. You can immediately make out body language. They're always close. 

Please remember, Chandrasekaran is, and you know this, a formidable professional, and he also is in the same grain of decency and dignity. These are not people who are deceitful; they are not like Ratan. These are decent people. They know how to behave; they have grace, they have dignity. Also, please understand, Noel was already on the trusts. Chandrasekaran has been chairman of Tata Sons since February 2017. They have an excellent relationship. 

My advice to all these people who fill your ear and the ears of a million other people is, rather than fill ears, why don't you have them cleaned? Because they always hear the wrong things. Let me tell you, this is a great relationship. It will be a great partnership. Of course, and Tam, on October 11, 2025, for a one-year anniversary show on Noel Tata's first year at Tata Trust, we will still be saying the same things. We will be talking about purpose, we'll talk about integrity, we'll talk about commitment, we'll talk about the greater good, and we'll talk about giving back in great measure. 

I hope we will be able to convince him to come on camera and talk about that. Is your problem; I'm not your Nation executive yet. No, I was going to invite you back a year from now. But if I'm alive, I will be there. Oh, God willing, of course you will be. But thank you so much, Soel. Always a pleasure to chat. Thank you for taking out the time and speaking with us. Thank you so much, lovely Tam. Thank you so much, and let me tell you, today is a very, very happy day on the back of an extremely sad day. But then, after every dark night, there's a springing dawn."
