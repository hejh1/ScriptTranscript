"Amit, I reckon that at the moment we want to start by talking about the latest that you have. We've seen you raise another 135 crores via your QIP. What are you going to use this fundraise for, and what are the working capital requirements at the moment? Are there more fundraisers on the table? 

Firstly, thank you for inviting me on your show. It has always been a pleasure to talk to you. This QIP fundraise has been, as you rightly mentioned, a significant development. Thank you for showing the clip before this particular interview. The space programs are going to go in a much different trajectory than what they are today. When it comes to space surveillance, we've been listening to certain news that has happened in the last couple of days prior to the space surveillance-based programs. I need not tell you that Paras Defense is right in the thick of it. 

Looking at the kind of opportunities that we have in front of us, be it space programs, our RF and microwave domain, or our Contraparas JV, any one of these will require a good amount of working capital. It assures you a good amount of healthy growth, and I think all of this put together, we want to be ready for the opportunities that are in store for us.

Hi Amit, Anushi joining in. You've mentioned one of your associate companies, which is Contraparas Technologies Private Limited. In fact, you also had an order win from L&T, which is about 305 crores. I want to understand from you, so talk to us about this order win. What does this mean for the company? Also, I want to understand why this award was not bid directly for, and why was it through an associate that we are seeing this order win for the company? 

Firstly, I would like to tell you what the product is. The product is an electro-optic infrared camera, if I would call it in a simpler way. This is a technology that is very critical in its own domain. India does not have this at the level that Contraparas delivers to the world. Contraparas is one of the world's leading companies when it comes to these kinds of EIR PODS, and the reason for partnering with Contraparas was to bring this technology to our country. 

Now, when we are seeing this, a lot of components that go into these kinds of systems are manufactured by Paras themselves. By partnering with Contraparas, who was initially our customer, it now brings us to a level where most of the components that go inside this particular camera will be manufactured within Paras, allowing us to deliver more than 50% indigenous content in line with Make in India for this particular critical technology, which is required for the Indian defense. 

Now, this particular program, which ID has won for CIWS, the camera will be a platform EIR system, and subsequently, the same system can be deployed across various platforms. 

Alright, well, moving on, Amit, I also want to understand considering your order flow. We also understand that you have given a rough guidance of around 25 to 30% in terms of your top-line growth over the next few years. Considering your order flow and the many steps India is taking, I'm sure you also have a lot of traction from your clients abroad as well. Have you considered upping your indication of what you may achieve with respect to revenues over the next few years? 

As you must be aware, I'm in a silent period, so I cannot give you absolute figures. But yes, you are right; our projections will turn out to be very conservative for this year and the coming years. 

Okay, Amit, that's fair that for now, the guidance remains at the 30% mark that you've mentioned. But I want to also talk about profitability. We've seen the margins; in fact, if you take Q1 into consideration, 28 to 29% was your margin rate, and you aim for better profitability going forward. I want to understand what will lead to this kind of margins that you're looking at moving forward, and can we see this 28 to 29% as a new sustainable range going forward for FY24 and beyond? 

The first answer to your last question is yes, it will be the new normal and better from there. What is increasing and influencing our profits is our domain. Optics and optronic systems are doing much better and have good visibility, good funnel, and good opportunities not just in defense but, like we discussed, in space as well. This is a drastic influencer when it comes to profitability. 

Secondly, the company is making a paradigm shift from a component manufacturer to a subsystem manufacturer and now to a complete system manufacturer. So when we are doing complete systems, we are manufacturing a lot of those components that go inside our own systems, which increases the profitability of the end product. So all of this put together, yes, we are looking at a better profitable business in the coming future. 

Amit, you know, going forward as well, do you think that the mix of optics and optronics to defense could change, or do you think that the 70-30 mix will continue going forward? 

It's a chicken-and-egg story. The defense engineering gives us a much faster turnaround time, and it gives us reach into almost all the programs that are there in the defense sector. But optics and optronic systems take us into tier one because of products like submarine periscopes. It is also our step into space. Why Paras Defense and space? Because we deliver optics and optical assemblies for space applications. 

Now, today we are in the process of already delivering space-borne cameras. You can see the surveillance requirements, the space surveillance requirements of the country, will largely be catered by us in collaboration with ISRO. So you can imagine that the optics and optronic systems will grow, but defense engineering, because of the opportunity size in front of us, will grow as well. There will be a slight skew where optics and optronic systems may be about 55-60%, and defense engineering might be about 40-45%. 

Okay, so 55 to 60% is the mix that we are looking for in the optics and optronic systems. But now coming to your order book, firstly I want to understand what is the current updated order book value that one should look at. If you take FY24 into account, that stood at roughly around 630 crores. So from there on, is it at a similar level? Also, in terms of order pipeline and opportunity, where are we seeing more of these opportunities from in terms of geographies and segments? If you can break that down for us. 

Like I mentioned to you, I won't be able to give you absolute figures, but I think if you put the math together, the order book has only been improving from the last figures that you have. The product mix, if I have to mention, will be optics and optronic systems, largely covering more than 50%, and defense engineering will also cover about 45% plus. 

In the segments and application areas, if you want to say, it is a mix of both land, space, and naval applications. We are looking at how we can improve our foothold in the avionic sector, as well as the aerospace sector. We would want to become one of those companies that would be putting EIR camera systems onto UAVs and drones. So that's the kind of growth we are looking at currently. All of this comes from our existing segments of optics, optronic systems, and defense engineering. 

Amit, that's fair to understand where you're looking at the order opportunities coming in from. But you know, in your business vision, you've also mentioned that you aim to be the number one anti-drone company in India and among the top five drone companies in India. I want to understand where you currently stand. What's your positioning like? What's the kind of market share you hold, and what is the growth like for the future in this area that you're looking at? 

Maybe I also wanted you to ask me this question. Yes, the anti-drone systems are a very critical and complex technology segment, and Paras is very proud that we are doing significant and important work in this area. Today, if I have to say, there are segmentations: the first line of defense and second line of defense. The first line of defense consists of all the big companies doing a lot of good work in the anti-drone segment. The second line of defense is where Paras is, and we are doing substantial work. 

Starting from next month onwards, we will be rolling out products that not only can be used by defense but also by all security personnel and everyone who has industrial security requirements. These products are designed, developed, and manufactured in India by Paras Anti-Drone. 

Now, the opportunity size with Paras Anti-Drone is humongous. We've tracked the code by doing everything indigenous and controlling the cost, so we can not just be ready for the world but we are also cost-effective when it comes to solutions for the armed forces. 

Now, this is on the anti-drone side. On the drone side, yes, we are being very selective, with the low-hanging fruits being agricultural drones. We are there, and then we are looking at some drone opportunities aside from that, say cargo drones and things like that. So we will be looking at drones in a very selective way, because this particular space has become very crowded. There is a lot of competition, and a lot of good companies are also pitching in. We want to be a differentiator if we enter any particular segment, and hence we would be selective when it comes to what kind of drones and drone technologies we would be entering into. 

Right, okay, well, Amit, we leave it at that. Thank you so much for joining us and taking us through all that we've spoken about. It certainly has been another very insightful conversation."
