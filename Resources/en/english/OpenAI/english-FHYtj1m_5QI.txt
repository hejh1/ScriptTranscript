All right, I want to read an email I got from a viewer named Tracy Brandon. Hi Ellen, my name is Tracy. I'm a single mother to a beautiful boy named Miles. Miles and I watch your show together every day, and it never fails to make us laugh, so I'm writing to say thank you. You have no idea the impact you've made on my life. My co-workers call me Smiles because no matter what I'm going through, I always make sure to smile. And watching you is what keeps me smiling through the tough times, so keep doing you, Ellen, because you really do change people's lives. Love, Tracy. So Tracy right now is backstage in a dressing room with Jeannie. Let's check in. We're gonna use our Cisco technology, and Tracy thinks that she's being interviewed for EllenTube. She's one of my biggest fans. Let's just, Jeannie obviously is in on this. Jeannie, if you can hear me, blink five times really fast. Blink five times really, really, really fast. All right, and then put one left hand way in the air. Put left hand way in the air, like way high. Yeah. My circumstances are hard, I'm a single mom, but- Wave it around. Wave the hand around like that. Right, and blink really fast. Keep blinking really, really fast. That's great. All right, I'm gonna surprise Tracy right now. All right, let's pop in right now. Hi, hi, hey Tracy. Hi, Ellen. What's going on, Tracy? I'm doing great. Good, good. You're sitting there with Jeannie? Yeah. Yeah. We're talking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're talking right now. Yeah, Jeannie, she doesn't seem to be that surprised. Tracy, you're not that surprised, are you? No, I'm not that surprised. Why are you surprised? I'm glad to meet you, though. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're not supposed to be surprised, because we're not surprising you, because you're an actress that we hired. We're surprising Jeannie. Jeannie, come on out here. Oh. Oh my god. Hi. Oh my god. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. When I was telling you to blink, and then I started telling you to raise your hand that you just did it. Well, I just, I do whatever you say. You're my boss. Move your hair. Move it. And I thought, oh, you know, this is this normal thing that you tell, that some of the taller people do. Right. So I was like, oh, this is funny. Yeah. And then when she wasn't getting scared, I was like, or when she wasn't surprised, I was like. I know. I was like, Ellen, like, no one has ever done this before. I know. I saw you just, like, keep pointing, like, it's Ellen. Like, do you need to recognize her? Everybody knows who she is. Yeah, no. She's an actress. We hired her. We're surprising you. So this is your 10th anniversary being on the show. No. Yeah. Oh, no. It is. Ten years. And I'm, I'm literally in shock right now. I know you're in shock. You were just sitting in the audience one day, ten years ago, and this is what we've gone through together in ten years. Wow. Hello? Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. So we met today. What? Hello? Hi. Is Jeannie there? Yes, this is her. Hey, Jeannie, it's Ellen DeGeneres calling. How you doing? Are you kidding me? No, I'm not. How are you? So you've entered every contest and you've never won one contest. No, I haven't. All right. Do you know why I'm calling you? To tell you you still have not won anything. Nothing. What do you need? I need a job. A job? Yes, ma'am. I mean, I'll, like, clean your bathroom. Okay. I don't know why we wouldn't bring Jeannie to see a show and see if she wants to clean a bathroom or something. We like your personality, so we talked about it this afternoon. We want to offer you a job here. Jeannie is outside West Virginia right now. Let's check in with Jeannie in Dallas. Jeannie? It's Ellen! You're talking to Ellen! Trish and her family live in South Hero, Vermont, and it was way too cold for us to bring them here, so we sent Jeannie there. Negative 6 with a wind chill of negative 28. Hi! Nice to meet you! Jeannie! Jeannie! Jeannie! That's you. You're the little one. And who is that that you're hugging? That is my favorite teacher in my whole life. That's Ms. Beck. You said you wanted to go see a Broadway show, right? Yeah, I'd like to. Have you ever been in a Broadway show? No. I got you a small part in Wicked. I feel like the luckiest person in the world. And now, I'm paying it forward by helping some very special Ellen fans experience their very own firsts. I got a letter from Sasha. She has three brothers and sisters who she has never met before. You've waited so long. And you're saying you don't have to because we brought them here. You are kidding me! And they're right behind you, Sasha. Oh my God! For the past ten years, I have gotten to be a part of giving the most amazing things to really wonderful people. Hey Jeannie, it's Ellen DeGeneres calling. That was the phone call that changed my life. I really got to say, you know, I really do. I have the best job in the whole world. And getting to work for you and work with all these people, you know, she's the best and it just trickles down to every person that we work with. And it's just, it's the best place and I'm so grateful for that. Well, I'm grateful. Thank you. I'm grateful for you because I feel the same way. I have the greatest group of people working with me every single day except for Andy. But I walk in and when you're not at that desk, I know you're someplace on assignment doing something wonderful for us. And so you're a huge part of this show. Huge part of this show. So we wanted to make it official that you're always going to be a big part of this show. So you have your own seat in the audience. You have Jeannie's seat. Thank you so much. You're welcome. We'll be back. So we sent you out on assignment and you did Ford's Life's First Evers, right? And what is your favorite part about doing that? Oh my gosh. Well, you want to know what? I always say my favorite thing to get to do is to get to be a little part of what you do every day, which is you find these amazing, incredible people that have the most amazing stories and getting to share it with everyone. It touches me and the stories that we found for this were just so awesome and the people are so awesome and it was one of the greatest experiences it really was. It's fun to do that for people, isn't it? It's so fun. You feel so blessed and so lucky every time you do. Well, let me tell you something. Our friends at Ford were so happy with your Life's First Ever series, they want you to have your very own first ever Ford EcoSport. No! No way! No way! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Holy smokes! I've never gotten a warning for it! I've never gotten to do this before! This is your part! Oh my gosh! Holy smokes! I know. I know. There you go. Oh my gosh! This was so fun. You can watch Jeannie's digital series Life's First Evers on Ellentube right now.
