All right, I want to read an email I got from a viewer named Tracy Brandon. Hi, Ellen. My name is Tracy. I'm a single mother to a beautiful boy named Miles. Miles and I watch your show together every day, and it never fails to make us laugh. So I'm writing to say thank you. You have no idea the impact you've made on my life. My coworkers call me smiles, because no matter what I'm going through, I always make sure to smile. And watching you is what keeps me smiling through the tough times. So keep doing you, Ellen, because you really do change people's lives.
So Tracy right now is backstage in a dressing room with Jeannie. Let's check in. We're gonna use our Cisco technology. And Tracy thinks that she's being interviewed for Ellen Tube. She's one of my biggest fans. Let's just, Jeannie obviously is in on this. Jeannie, if you can hear me blink five times really fast. Blink five times really, really, really fast. All right. And then put one left hand way in the air. Put left hand way in the air, like way high. Yeah.
- Great, great. - I'm a single mom, but-- - Wave it around. Wave the hand around like that. - I'm a single mom. - Right. And blink really fast. Keep blinking really, really fast. That's great. - All right. I'm gonna get some dry spaces right now. - Get in! - All right. - Take a break. - Take a break. - Let's pop in right now. - Hi.

She's-- Jeannie, she doesn't seem to be that surprised. Tracy, you're not that surprised, are you? No, I'm not that surprised. Why is she surprised? I'm glad to meet you, though. Yeah, yeah. You're not supposed to be surprised, because we're not surprising you, because you're an actress that we hired. We're surprising Jeannie.
Come on out here. Oh my god. I-- oh my god. I-- when I was feeling a blink, and then
started telling you to raise your hand that you just did it? Well, I just-- I do whatever you say. You're my boss. Move your hair. You're-- move-- And I thought, oh, you know, this is this normal thing that you tell-- that so much you tell our people to do. Right. So I was like, oh, this is funny. Yeah. And then when she wasn't getting scared, I was like-- or when she wasn't surprised at you, I was like-- I know. It's Ellen. Like, no one has ever done this before. I know. What do I do? I saw you just, like, keep pointing, like, it's Ellen. Like, do you recognize-- You're sweet. Yeah, no. Everybody knows who she is. She's an actress. We hired her.
So this is your 10th anniversary being on the show. - No. - Yeah, it is. - Oh, no. - 10 years. - I'm--I'm literally in shock right now. - I know you're in shock. You were just sitting in the audience one day 10 years ago, and this is what we've gone through together in 10 years. - Oh, no. - Wow. - Hello? - Hi, is Jeannie there? - Yes, this is her. - Hey, Jeannie, it's Ellen DeGeneres calling. How you doing?
Are you kidding me? No, I'm not. How are you? So you've entered every contest and you've never won one contest. No, I haven't. All right, do you know why I'm calling you? To tell you so you still have not won anything. Nothing. What do you need? I need a job. A job? Yes, ma'am. I mean, I'll clean your bathroom. Okay. I don't know why we wouldn't bring

very special Ellen fans experience their very own firsts. I got a letter from Sasha. She has three brothers and sisters who she has never met before. You've waited so long. And you just think you don't have to because we brought them here. You are kidding me. And they're right behind you, Sasha. Oh my god. Oh my god. -
