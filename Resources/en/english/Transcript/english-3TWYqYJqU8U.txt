So if you've ever been put down or told that you're not good enough, first of all ignore and use that fuel to push you on to wall.
your dreams. She's working to teach young girls about self-love and the beauty of all body types. Hello! How amazing to be here! So I am Pete Winslet. Born in Reading Barccia, I have two sisters and one brother. I have a mom and a dad.
Our mum was just our mum, a great cook and storyteller, sometimes worked in a local sandwich shop. My dad was a postman, a van driver, a tarmac shoveler, a Christmas tree seller, and he did many other odd jobs along the way to make ends meet. He was also an actor. Yes he was.
He always loved it. And even though he rarely made any money from it, he still loved it. He was happy.
But what was I going to do now? How was I going to realize my dream of being on stage? I never even dared to think about being in films. So first things first, I got a job at the same sandwich shop as my mum.
myself to others. You see, I'd been bullied at school. They could
here that a lot. And so, these comments about how I learned
comfortable in my own skin. It made it hard. I wanted to give up. Maybe I should rethink this acting thing I said to myself. But it was my passion. And it made me happy. And surely nobody can take my happiness away. So I had to rise above it. I had to dig deep. Be strong. Because deep down I wanted to play sandy in Greece. And I wanted to be Annie. I wanted to be Maria in West Side Story.
I wanted to be in the world of my dreams on stage. I was done with being told I look wrong. I was done with being told I didn't fit that perfect mold. I wanted to be an actress and nothing was going to stop me. So what did I do? What did I do? I didn't lock myself away and give up on my dream. I fought back. I had to ignore the negative comments. I had to believe in myself. I had to
choose to rise above it all and I had to work hard. You have to be indestructible to do what you love and believe that you are worth it. Yes, believe that you are worth it and sometimes that's the hardest part. Wrong hair, big feet, wrong face, too ordinary, not right, don't fit next. And I was the W in the alphabet. So I came last, I was always stuck at the end of the queue.
but I stayed focused until W was called out and it was my turn. Kate Winslet, are you ready? The question is, are you ready for me? I would tell myself. I would tell myself, come on, are you ready for me world? And so I kept working. I kept working and I kept trying my best. And then one day, I was cast as rose.
in Titanic. The most, the most unlikely candidate, Kate from the sandwich shop in Redding, suddenly acting in one of the biggest movies ever made. You can be, you can be from anywhere and you can do anything, believe it.
It is possible to overcome your fears. What if I fail, fall over my big feet? Who cares? Be you, be you. I learn to embrace my flaws, to make no apology for who I am. I dug deep. And I decided that I simply wouldn't listen when they said that my body didn't fit. This is who I am, the real me, Kate from Reading.
in the mirror took a deep breath and I said to myself, get out there, get out there and go for it. Now I'm not anti-teacher and I am not anti-excellent at all. Some of your teachers will be the greatest inspiration of your life, so make the most of them while you can.
easily compare ourselves to others. School can be a great time but it can also be a very cruel time. The way not just to survive but to thrive in these precious years of your lives is to work out who you are, figure out what makes you truly happy and hang on to that time. Take time. Hang on to it. Take that time, time, make time, make the time.
figure out who you really want to be. Now, I am going to share one quick and easy idea how to do that. And you're going to hate me for this. Put down your phone. I use my phone all the time. I do it too. I use my phone all the time. Whether it's to make photos, take photos like most of us do or text my mum or look up directions. But today, social media So many of us have just basic conversation.
constantly distracted from being our true selves in a world that is fueled by insta-tweet book faces I like to call it. So ask yourself, ask yourself, is your phone making you helping you to be happy? Are you using it? Are you using it in the correct way for you? Are all those fantastic people you follow? Are they having a better time than you really? Are they making you feel unsettled or unsatisfied? Does it dent to your self-esteem?
not to get those likes. Does it chip away at your true self? Is it even the real you?
and from being told that I wasn't quite right to do what I loved is the person that has made me who I am today Talking to you with all my flaws and all my imperfections And so perhaps for some of you the persona that you found yourself creating online is just a version of perfect And maybe that's hard to step away from.
So let's take that energy and time.
But for how many of you is it becoming a distraction from your real life? Maybe ask yourself. Maybe ask yourself, do you really need to be posting that photo of your lunch? Just enjoy eating it.  Life happens between the cracks in the silences, in those moments walking out of a lesson and before you go into the next one.
Walking down the street and it isn't always easy, but you could be missing it. Don't give all your time to your phone. It won't give you the answers. Promise yourself time on a rainy day, on a sunny day, to just
Don't be afraid to make mistakes.  Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. You will only learn from them. Find time to dream your own dreams. Society is changing so fast. What we value is changing so fast. And it's not easy being a teenager. Is it? No, it's not. It's becoming harder than ever in a world of peer pressure and awful things such as sightseeing.
