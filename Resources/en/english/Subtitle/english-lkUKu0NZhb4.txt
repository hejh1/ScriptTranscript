"All right, our first guest is one of the most famous actors in the world. He's nominated for a Golden Globe for his brilliant performance in The Wolf of Wall Street. Please welcome Leonardo DiCaprio! 

First off, I gotta say, I saw some of you guys dancing there, and you guys were absolutely killing it! [Applause] In the trailer, they show a little bit of him dancing. You're a great dancer! That little scene where you're dancing—you're a good dancer. 

I used to be a pop locker when I was in elementary school. 

Were you? 

Yeah, it's actually one of the reasons why I didn't get an agent. Because I auditioned, and I had like a punk rock haircut and I dressed like a little, you know, street dancer, and they rejected me. 

Oh yeah? 

Yeah, I disagree with that because I met you when you were like 16 years old, and you had just done This Boy's Life, which was your first film, right? 

Really? It was on Hollywood Boulevard, right? 

Yes, we were at an after party at like the Chinese Theater or something, and I'm telling you, you were so special and charming. I just was listening to you talk, and then you told me you just finished that film. I had never seen you in anything, but I just knew you were going to be somebody because you were so charming. 

Then you did What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and you were amazing in that! [Applause] I claim stake on you; I think I'm responsible for your career. 

Well, I've always been a big fan of yours ever since I first met you. Thank you very much! 

But really, this performance in this movie is—I really want to say it's your best performance I've ever seen. You've done some great movies, but in this movie, your performance is outstanding, and you're nominated for a Golden Globe—well deserved! 

You were there—I hosted the Oscars in 2007, and you were there in the front row. You were nominated for Blood Diamond. 

I'm hosting again this year, and I pray I'm looking out there and seeing you in the audience for this because you deserve to be there! Or just come anyway! 

Yeah, even if you don't get nominated, as a seat filler. 

I just love those seat fillers! 

Yeah, just be there. Literally, as soon as you leave the bathroom, somebody just scoots in. 

Excuse me! 

They're just right there, all dressed up. 

All right, so tell everybody about this movie. You produced it as well, right? 

Yes, I did. 

So you took a long time to make it? 

Well, I had been fascinated by this book. I mean, Jordan Belfort looks at this as a cautionary tale. He's sort of reflecting on his wild, debaucherous, hedonistic days on Wall Street, where he was consumed by greed and excess. But he was so candid and honest about it, and I really wanted to put this up on screen because, in a lot of ways, it felt like a reflection of the time that we were living in. I mean, really, anything goes in this film. It is absolutely wild. And, you know, Martin Scorsese and I decided to really pull no punches and really go for it. 

Yeah, I can't believe that everything you see—when you see this film, it's, first of all, so good. And you and Jonah Hill together— 

But the scene when you take Quaaludes in the ambulance—I'm from New Orleans, we say "qualities." 

I'm kidding! I'm not kidding! I know what they're called; I'm from New Orleans! 

So Quaaludes—when you take the Quaaludes and you have to make your way down the steps to the car, it is genius how you do that! How many takes did you have to do? 

Oh God, we worked on that whole sequence for a week. One of my favorite sequences in Goodfellas is where Ray Liotta's mixing the marinara, he's doing drugs, he's got the helicopters circling around him, and his nanny wants to take her hat, and the cops are coming after him. We wanted to do kind of a film within a film, so we really worked really hard on this Quaalude sequence where, essentially, Donnie has a botched money deal, who's played by Jonah Hill, and to apologize for that, he gives me these incredibly powerful Quaaludes. I simultaneously find out that my house is being bugged by the FBI, and I gotta get back home to him because he's on the phone with Switzerland. It turns into this sort of insane sequence, and it was probably the most wild thing I've ever done in my entire life. Jonah Hill and I looked at each other and said, "How are we allowed to do this? How are we allowed to get paid to do this for a living?" It was just insane! 

And just to take that much time to try to crawl downstairs and to try to open a car door that opens up, and for your foot to get caught on that door—everything! I mean, that just was hilarious! 

I appreciate that! I mean, it all resulted in this insane sequence at the end where Jonah decides to stuff ham into his mouth as well, and he crashes into a plate glass table. And we were doing the CPR sequence, and you know the big challenge that day? We had to do 70 takes because they couldn't get this ham to stick on my face! They had to put KY Jelly, and there was literally a guy there behind this giant with a plastic spoon just flicking ham on my face all day long as I'm doing this insane sequence. But it was almost—it was one of the most surreal things I've ever done in my entire career. 

Well, I know you both are friends anyway, and there's a lot of improvisation in there, so there must have been takes where you just couldn't make it through. 

I mean, the whole film was like that, and he's one of the greatest improvisational actors I've ever gotten to work with. He's a real genius and a good guy. He really came to me and said, "Look, I know what this world is like. I know what these people are. There's no one that should play this role except for me." And I immediately told Marty about that, and he hired him on the spot. 

His clothes, what he's wearing, his giant white teeth—just everything! It's great! I really enjoyed the film, and I really enjoyed both of your performances, but I really think it's the best I've ever seen you be. There are so many levels and layers—it's just fun to watch! 

We'll take a break, and we'll talk about more with Leo after this. 

That looks like he was just coming off of Dallas Buyers Club because he was still really thin. 

In the last, how many years did it take you to do three films? 

I did three films back to back. I did Gatsby, Django Unchained, and then went straight into this. 

Wow! 

Thank you! 

In one year? 

Now in one year, it was about a year and a half. 

Wow, that's amazing! 

You forget about Django Unchained and Gatsby. So when you—how long have you been off now? 

It's been about a year, and I still don't have—I mean, this film took really everything out of me. 

But you're good at relaxing! 

I'm great! 

Yeah, well, if you're just doing nothing around, you can come here every day! 

Yeah, you can come by! 

I just put a chair back there and just sort of stare at you like— 

Right! 

I'll just put a chair right there, and you just sit there in a really creepy way. 

Just like... 

I'll just be sitting up— 

Nothing's creepy about you looking at me! That's fine! 

You had an amazing fundraiser, and you sold art for your environmental foundation. What is the name of it? 

It's called LDF, and we kind of focus on protecting endangered species and their ecosystems. So coral reef systems, jungles that are home to top predators—sharks, tigers, things like that. 

I love that! 

Yeah, I love that you're doing that! And I think when people are afraid of anything—whatever it is, a person or an animal—when you don't understand it and you're afraid of it, we feel like we must destroy it. You know, sharks are amazing creatures! 

Absolutely! They're the top of the food chain, and 90% of them have sort of been eliminated from the oceans. But you know the truth is that these things have no voice, you know? And only 2% of philanthropy goes towards environmentalism, which is microscopic compared to the benefits that it gives us. So, you know, my whole goal with that auction was to really try to isolate some of these places and protect them for all time. That's my goal. 

And you had an encounter with a shark, right? 

Yeah, a few! But didn't one get in? Weren't you in a cage or something? 

You got in there? 

You know, when I work with these NGOs, these non-profit organizations, you kind of go on the ground; you see what's happening. I did a whole excursion where I went to Nepal, went on elephant back, and looked for tigers. Of course, for four days I was there, I didn't see a single tiger. They blend into the jungle, and the elephants sort of go up on their hind legs and react to a tiger being there, but you can't actually see them. 

And then I went to—wait, what happens when you're on an elephant and it goes on its hind legs? 

Hold on! 

Okay, you hold on for your life! 

Thank you! 

Yes, and then I went scuba diving looking for sharks, and I had a huge fear of sharks. When I did Blood Diamond in 2006, I actually got stuck in a cage with a great white, which was awesome! 

How big was the great white? 

It was a gigantic great white! And what do you mean it was in? 

Yeah, how did you survive that? 

I don't know! I don't know! 

Then you're making it up! 

No, I'm not! I'm not! They actually said in 30 years this has never happened, but the tuna kind of got stuck on the top of the cage, and the great white leapt out, tried to bite it, and it went into the cage with me. Half of its body was in and out, and I flattened down at the bottom, and it was this far away! It chomped a few times, but I survived it! 

And the work that they're doing is great; they're protecting sharks as well! So I don't want to—you don't need to go do that anymore! 

I don't want to do that anymore! 

But you know, I don't want to discount their work because they're doing great stuff, but it was absolutely terrifying! 

And then you also jumped out of a plane recently, right? 

Oh, that was when I was 21. 

Okay, and yeah, both my shoots didn't open! I have a knack for this kind of stuff! 

Yeah, so it was tandem? You were with someone? 

Yes, tandem! 

Okay, so you open one shoot and it doesn't open, and then the second one didn't open, and then there's no third? What happens? 

Finally, after like—the gentleman who was on my back shaking it for, you know, a good minute while we were free falling towards Earth, it finally started to pop open, and we kind of landed in the nick of time! 

What are your thoughts when that's happening? 

Sucks! 

When you feel the guy that's in control trying to open the second shoot? 

I mean, to tell you the truth, it's kind of the same thing as getting into a fender bender. It's like you just sit there and go, "Wow, this sucks! I'm gonna die!" And there's really nothing I can do about it. 

No one gets in a fender bender and says, "I'm gonna die!" 

No, but it's the same emotional reaction! 

No, you're just cool! That's what it is; you're just too cool! 

I love you! You know that? You're doing great work in every area. Your acting is fantastic, and what you're doing for the environment—we appreciate it! 

Go to our website if you want to learn more about his foundation. You should get invested and get involved if you can! The Wolf of Wall Street is in theaters now. Sara Bareilles is going to perform after this. That's Leo DiCaprio! Thank you, guys!"
