All right, I want to read an email I got from a viewer named Tracy Brandon.
Hi, Ellen.
My name is Tracy.
I'm a single mother to a beautiful boy named Miles.
Miles and I watch your show together every day, and it never fails to make us laugh.
So I'm writing to say thank you.
You have no idea the impact you've made on my life.
My coworkers called me smiles because no matter what I'm going through,
I always make sure to smile.
And watching you is what keeps me smiling through the tough times.
So keep doing you, Ellen, because you really do change people's lives.
Love Tracy.
So Tracy right now is backstage in a dressing room with Jeannie.
Let's check in.
We're going to use our Cisco technology.
And Tracy thinks that she's being interviewed for Ellen Tube.
She's one of my biggest fans.
Let's just-- Jeannie obviously is in on this.
Jeannie, if you can hear me, blink five times really fast.
Blink five times really, really, really fast.
All right.
And then put one left hand way in the air.
Put a left hand wave in the air.
Like.
Wave high.
Yeah.
My circumstances are hard.
I'm still a mom, but--
Wave it around.
Wave the hand around like that.
And blink really fast.
Keep blinking really, really fast.
That's great.
Amazing.
OK.
All right.
I'm going to surprise Tracy right now.
And get it.
All right.
Ting right.
Let's pop in right now.
Hi.
Hi.
Hey, Tracy.
Hi, Ellen.
What's going on, Tracy?
I'm doing great.
Good.
Just kidding.
You're sitting there with Jeannie?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're talking.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're talking right now.
She's-- Jeannie, she doesn't seem to be that surprised.
Tracy, you're not that surprised, right?
No, I'm not that surprised.
I'm surprised.
I'm glad to meet you, though.
Yeah, yeah.
You're not supposed to be surprised,
because we're not surprising you.
Because you're an actress that we hired.
We're surprising.
Jeannie, Jeannie, come on out here.
Oh, my God.
Hi.
Oh, my God.
Hi.
When I was telling you to blink, and then I started telling
you to raise your hand that you just did it.
Well, I just-- I do whatever you say.
You're my boss.
Move your hair.
And I thought, oh, you know, this is this normal thing
that some of you tell our people do.
Right.
So I was like, oh, this is funny.
Yeah.
And then when she wasn't getting scared,
I was like, when she wasn't surprised,
she was like, I know.
It's Ellen, like, no one has ever done this before.
I know.
What do I do?
I thought you just keep pointing, like, it's Ellen.
I do.
You're recognize.
Yeah.
She's an actress.
We hired her.
We're surprising you.
So this is your 10th anniversary being on the show.
No.
Yeah.
It is.
Oh, no.
10 years.
And I'm literally in shock right now.
I know you're in shock.
You were just sitting in the audience one day, 10 years ago.
And this is what we've gone through together in 10 years.
Hello.
Hi, it's Jeannie there.
Yes, this is her.
Hey, Jeannie.
It's Ellen DeGeneres calling.
How you doing?
Are you kidding me?
No, I'm not.
How are you?
So you've entered every contest, and you've never won one contest.
No, I haven't.
All right, do you know why I'm calling you?
To tell you, you still have not won anything.
Nothing.
What do you need?
I need a job.
A job.
Yes, ma'am.
I mean, I'll like clean your bathroom.
OK.
I don't know why we wouldn't bring Jeannie to see a show
and see if she wants to clean a bathroom or something.
We like your personality.
So we talked about it this afternoon.
We want to offer you a job here.
Jeannie is outside West Virginia right now.
Let's check in with Jeannie and Dallas.
Jeannie is in Ontario.
Jeannie?
There you go.
You're talking to Ellen?
Chris and her family live in South Hero, Vermont,
and it was way too cold for us to bring them here,
so we sent Jeannie there.
It's negative six with a window of negative 28.
Jeannie!
That's you.
You're the little one.
And who is that that you're hugging?
Hey, that isn't my favorite teacher.
In my whole life, that's Miss Beck.
You said you wanted to go see a Broadway show, right?
Well, I--
Yeah, I'd like to.
Yeah.
Have you ever been in a Broadway show?
No.
I got you a small part in Wicked.
Oh my gosh!
This is on my bucket!
This is on my bucket list!
Yes, I never really thought this would be real!
I feel like the luckiest person in the world.
And now, I'm paying it forward by helping some very special Ellen fans experience their very own firsts.
I got a letter from Sasha.
She has three brothers and sisters who she has never met before.
You've waited so long.
And you're saying you don't have to because we brought them here.
You are kidding me?
And they're right behind you, Sasha.
For the past 10 years, I have gotten to be a part of giving the most amazing things to really wonderful people.
Hey, Jeannie.
It's Ellen DeGeneres calling.
That was the film called It Changed My Life.
I really got the same.
You know, I really do.
I have the best job in the whole world and getting to work for you and work with all these people.
You know, she's the best and it just trickles down to every person that we work with.
And it's just it's the best place and I'm so grateful for that.
Well, so I'm grateful.
Thank you.
I'm grateful for you because I feel the same way.
I have the greatest group of people working with me every single day except for Andy.
But I walk in and when you're not at that desk, I know you're someplace on assignment doing something wonderful for us.
And so you're a huge part of the show.
Huge part of the show.
So we wanted to make it official that you're always going to be a big part of the show.
So you have your own seat in the audience.
You have...
You have your own seat.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
We'll be back.
So we sent you out on assignment and you did Ford's life's first-ever's, right?
Yes.
And what is your favorite part about doing that?
Oh, my gosh.
Well, you want to know what?
I always say my favorite thing to get to do is to get to be a little part of what you do every day.
Which is you find these amazing, incredible people that have the most amazing stories and getting to share it with everyone.
And it just, it touches me.
And the stories that we found for this were just so awesome and the people are so awesome.
And it was one of the greatest experiences it really was.
It's fun to do that for people, isn't it?
It's so fun.
You feel so blessed and so lucky as I do.
Right.
Well, let me tell you something.
Okay.
Our friends at Ford were so happy with your life's first-ever series.
They want you to have your very own first-ever Ford Echo Sport.
No!
No!
I know.
I know.
There you go.
Oh, my God!
This is so fun.
You can watch Jeannie's Digital Series
Life's First Evers on Ellen Tube right now.
