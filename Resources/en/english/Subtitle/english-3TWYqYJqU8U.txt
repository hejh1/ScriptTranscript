"Hello!
How amazing to be here!
So I am Kate Winslet.
Born in Reading Berkshire, I have two sisters and one brother, I have a mum and a dad.
Our mum was just our mum, a great cook and storyteller, sometimes worked in a local
sandwich shop.
My dad was a postman, a van driver, a tarmac shoveler, a Christmas tree seller and he
did many other odd jobs along the way to make ends meet.
He was also an actor, yes he was, more out of work than in it, but he always loved it
and even though he rarely made any money from it, he still loved it, he was happy and it
made me want to be an actor too.
At school I wasn't very good at maths, I was okay at English, pretty rubbish at history,
but the thing I loved, I loved was drama, it was my passion.
Yes, it was my passion.
I was always auditioning for the school plays, I didn't really get very good parts mind you
but I didn't mind, I didn't care, I would often get cast as the crocodile or the scarecrow
or the daft fairy, I was even a dancing frog once, but it didn't matter, I still loved
it, I loved acting, it didn't matter how big or small the parts were, I wanted to be great
and I was determined to keep learning, so I did my GCSEs, I did okay, nothing in life
comes for free, my dad would say, do good work, I tried my best, I did good work, I got
an A star for drama, it was the only A I got, I got my A, oh yeah, but what was I going
to do now?
How was I going to realise my dream of being on stage, I never even dared to think about
being in films, so first things first, I got a job at the same sandwich shop as my mum,
that way I could save enough money each week to pay for the train fairs to London to go
on auditions, I didn't get that many auditions back then, and it was tough, I never got the
parts, I tried so hard to get them but I never got them and I was always comparing myself
to others, you see I'd been bullied at school, they called me blubber, they teased me for
wanting to act, locked me in the cupboard, laughed at me, I wasn't the prettiest, I've
always had big feet, and I was even told that I might be lucky in my acting if I was happy
to settle for the fat girl parts, ever let go, never let go, and they would say, you're
just not really what we're looking for Kate, and so I'd hear that a lot, and so these
comments about how I looked started to crop up and I'd never really dared to think about
how I looked before, I was just kind of ordinary, nothing special, but this unkindness made
me feel truly horrendous, I felt I wasn't enough, I wasn't good enough, I didn't look
right and all because I didn't fit into someone else's idea of perfect, I didn't have the
perfect body, and I would rarely hear anything positive, so I started to feel uncomfortable
in my own skin, it made it hard, I wanted to give up, maybe I should rethink this acting
thing I said to myself, but it was my passion, and it made me happy, and surely nobody can
take my happiness away, so I had to rise above it, I had to dig deep, be strong, because
deep down I wanted to play sandy in Grease, and I wanted to be Annie, and I wanted to
be Maria in West Side Story, I wanted to be in the world of my dreams on stage, I was
done with being told I looked wrong, I was done with being told I didn't fit that perfect
mold, I wanted to be an actress, and nothing was going to stop me, so what did I do, what
did I do, I didn't lock myself away and give up on my dream, I fought back, I had to ignore
the negative comments, I had to believe in myself, I had to choose to rise above it all, and
I had to work hard, you have to be indestructible to do what you love, and believe that you
are worth it.
Yes, believe that you are worth it, and sometimes that's the hardest part, wrong hair, big feet,
wrong face, too ordinary, not right, don't fit, next, and I was the W in the alphabet,
so I came last, I was always stuck at the end of the queue, but I stayed focused until
W was called out, and it was my turn, Kate Winslet, are you ready?
The question is, are you ready for me, I would tell myself, I would tell myself come on,
are you ready for me world, and so I kept working, I kept working and I kept trying my best,
and then one day I was cast as Rose in Titanic, the most, the most unlikely candidate Kate
from the sandwich shop in Reading, suddenly acting in one of the biggest movies ever made,
you can be, you can be from anywhere, and you can do anything, believe it, it is possible
to overcome your fears, what if I fail, fall over my big feet, who cares, be you, be you,
I learn to embrace my flaws, to make no apology for who I am, I dug deep, and I decided that
I simply wouldn't listen when they said that my body didn't fit, this is who I am, the
real me, Kate from Reading, and so I looked in the mirror, took a deep breath and I said
to myself, get out there, get out there, and go for it, now I am not anti-teacher and
I am not anti-excellence at all, some of your teachers will be the greatest inspiration
of your life, so make the most of them while you can, for me the school of life has been
my greatest education, your school years are years you'll never get back and don't waste
them, but don't waste them feeling crushed by pressure either, pressure to achieve the
highest grades or to conform to pressure exerted by people around you, we so easily compare
ourselves to others, school can be a great time, but it can also be a very cruel time,
the way not just to survive but to thrive in these precious years of your lives is to
work out who you are, figure out what makes you truly happy, and hang on to that, time,
take time, hang on to it, take that time, time, make time, make the time to figure out who
you really want to be, now I am going to share one quick and easy idea how to do that, and
you're going to hate me for this, put down your phone, I use my phone all the time, I
do it too, I use my phone all the time, whether it's, it's to make photo, take photos like
like most of us do or text my mum or look up directions, but today social media robs
us of so many, so many of us have just basic conversation, we're constantly distracted
from being our true selves in a world that is fueled by insta-tweet bookface as I like
to call it, so ask yourself, ask yourself, is your phone making you, helping you to be
happy, are you using it, are you using it in the correct way for you, are all those fantastic
people you follow, are they having a better time than you really, are they making you
feel unsettled or unsatisfied, does it dent to your self esteem not to get those likes,
does it chip away at your true self, is it even the real you, maybe that person is a
role, perhaps you're losing a bit of yourself, think about that, let's think about that,
I get to play roles but they aren't real people, they really aren't, I get red carpets
are fun, it's fun to dress up, wear lipstick, but it isn't sustainable, it's not the real
me and being a real person is full of much more complex moments, the me that results
from my life experiences and having my eyes open, my heart broken and from being told
that I wasn't quite right to do what I loved is the person that has made me who I am today
talking to you with all my flaws and all my imperfections.
And so perhaps for some of you, the persona that you found yourself creating online is
just a version of perfect and maybe that's hard to step away from, so let's take that
energy and time, that precious time that you use and let's use that effort and make social
media a good thing, let's make it a great thing, a thing that can be a voice for change
and inspiration, let's stand in the way of letting it make us feel bad about ourselves.
Now don't get me wrong, don't get me wrong, when it's used in the right way, wow it can
be a powerful resource indeed, but for how many of you is it becoming a distraction from
your real life, maybe ask yourself, maybe ask yourself do you really need to be posting
that photo of your lunch, just enjoy eating it.
Life, life happens between the cracks, in the silences, in those moments walking out
of a lesson and before you go into the next one, we're just walking down the street and
it isn't always easy but you could be missing it, don't give all your time to your phone,
it won't give you the answers, promise yourself time on a rainy day, on a sunny day to just
be, to listen, to look, to breathe, do a sweaty sport where you can't even hold your phone,
do an art class, dance, how about doing art class and dance, with your friends, paint
each other, put your phones down for a few hours or even half a day, just leave it behind,
and don't be afraid to make mistakes, don't be afraid, don't be afraid to make mistakes,
you will only learn from them, find time to dream your own dreams, society is changing
so fast, what we value is changing so fast and it's not easy being a teenager, is it,
no it's not, it's becoming harder than ever in a world of peer pressure and awful things
such as cyberbullying and exposure to that unattainable aspiration, now more than ever
it's even harder to filter the nasties out and to escape things that might be upsetting
you, so my idea, not as an expert but simply as me, Kate from Reading, Kate from Reading
on we day, let's rethink how we social share, let's rethink how we social share, be kind,
be wise, let's think about how else to share, share a real chat with the person sitting
next to you, share stories, share being in this moment by talking or with a hug, with
a hug everybody, I'm hugging you all, the greatest happiness in my professional life,
you're chatting, look at that, the greatest happiness in my professional life comes when
I am entirely engaged in the work that I am doing, it fills me up, it's a happiness that
I get by being utterly present with the people around me and it rocks, now on a plane, on
a plane for those of you who've been on a plane, even those of you who haven't, during
the safety briefing they say, should there be a change in cabin pressure, your oxygen
mask will drop down in front of you, fit it over your nose and mouth and breathe normally,
fit your own mask first before helping others, allowing yourself to breathe first doesn't
mean you aren't able to help other people, it means you are better equipped to help them,
you are allowed to take a moment, I'm taking it right now, you are allowed to take a moment
to take a deep breath, you need air in your lungs to speak up for yourself, you need
breath to find your own voice and to use it mindfully, be proud of it, you need breath
to sing and to dance and to find joy in a complex world, help yourself be yourself and
listen, be the best version of your true self that you can be, be the best version, and
if, listen, if that best doesn't feel as fabulous as the girl or the boy who threw their social
sharing appears to be more fabulous than you are or you feel that you are, just know this,
you are being your best, and you own that and nobody can take that away from you ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever, so breathe, be present, put down your phone every once in a while,
work to achieve your wildest dreams and get out there and be true to you, get out there
and go for it because your generation has the power to rock the world, thank you, thank
