"Have you heard the term 'Zuckaissance'? Uh. No, what is-  
Zuckaissance! You haven't heard that?  
No, no. It's Zuck's renaissance. Huh. What is this? You know, you've got this new look, the chains, the shearling jacket. Everything you do seems to become a meme. At least make them good memes. Right, well, it seems  
like you're leaning in on the joke more. And I think as I've gotten older, I've just like, 'All right, whatever. It doesn't matter,' right? It's like, just kind of try to be myself as much as I feel comfortable being. Woohoo! Mark Zuckerberg, the face of Facebook, has been under the bright  
lights for 20 years, on the offensive, buying  
Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus, and on the defensive, battling a never-ending  
cascade of criticisms about the social, political,  
and business impacts of his expanding empire. Lately, though, Zuckerberg  
appears to be reinventing himself and his company. Meta's latest push is a  
major play to open-source AI in contrast to closed-source competitors like OpenAI and Google. Zuckerberg predicts his  
company's newest AI models will have a profound impact on the progress of technology, business, and maybe the world. I've come to Meta HQ to get  
a glimpse of the real Zuck and the AI future he  
believes is the path forward. So, I found an article  
in The Harvard Crimson going back to 2003 where you were talking about open source. Okay.  
Like over 20 years ago. Really? So, you've been thinking  
about this a really long time. Well, yeah. It's a big  
part of the tech industry. I mean, you wouldn't have been able to build the early version  
of Facebook without that. You know, I was a student. I didn't have access to a lot of capital. There's the whole kind of hacker mentality of you, like, just take the code, use it for the thing that you need to. It's more cost-efficient. And I mean, that's how you  
can start something like this in a dorm room. Some people see you as  
an unlikely champion of open source today. You're laughing. Well, I don't know why. I mean, I actually think,  
well, I get it, but, yeah. You understand the word 'unlikely.' Yeah. We've actually, at Meta, have  
been pretty big proponents of open source for a while and it's been a really  
good formula for us. So, dating back to how  
we designed servers, how we design our data centers, we have this whole Open Compute Project that kind of standardized a lot of the infrastructure  
for the industry. And that's gonna happen with AI too. You're really putting  
a stake in the ground by open-sourcing your AI in this attempt to build  
the AI rails for the future. How much of this is a strategic way to control or own the  
next technology wave? A lot of how we've grown up over the last 10 or 15 years was building our apps  
through phone platforms that our competitors controlled. So, it's somewhat soul-crushing to, like, go and build something that you think is gonna be good and then just get told by  
Apple that you can't ship it because they want to,  
like, put us in a box because they view us as competitive. You know, we're a big enough company now that one of the things that I've resolved is that for the next  
generation of technology, I want us to build and have more control over the next set of platforms  
that we're gonna build. So, I think AI is a critical one, and I think augmented and virtual reality is another critical one. It's kind of the way that we can control  
our own destiny on this and make sure that we  
have access to leading AI is by building it and having  
it become an industry standard, but it actually gets stronger  
by being able to share it and have the ecosystem around it. You're continuing to improve Meta AI across all of your products, but also as a standalone chatbot. Why should we use Meta over ChatGPT? Well, there's a bunch of  
things where it's better. You know, one of the things  
that we're rolling out soon is the ability to just,  
like, imagine stuff. You're typing something in real time, I do this with my daughters all the time, and as you're kind of typing and entering the query, it's just generating the images  
as you enter the keystrokes. It's just really cool. My goal for the Meta AI launch, which, I mean, it's only really,  
you know, a few months old at this point, was to, by the end of the year, have Meta AI be the most used  
AI assistant in the world, and I think we're basically  
on track for that. I mean, there's hundreds  
of millions of people who are using it.  
By the end of this year? Yeah, and I think we're gonna be there before the end of the year. So, you're releasing Llama 3.1, this family of models big and small, including the biggest  
open-source model ever, 405 billion parameters.  
Yeah, yeah. What does that jump unlock? I actually think the main  
thing that people are gonna do, especially because it's open source, is use it as a teacher  
to train smaller models that they use in different applications. If you just think about, like,  
all the startups out there or all the enterprises or even governments that are  
trying to do different things, they probably all need to, at some level, build custom models  
for what they're doing. And it's really hard to do that with closed systems out there, whether that's OpenAI or Gemini, Google's thing or whatever. And this gets  
to a pretty core part of our philosophy: we don't believe there's  
gonna be, like, one AI to rule them all. Our vision is that there's  
going to be millions or just billions of  
different models out there. So, not one God, but many, is that the way to think about it? Well, I don't think they're gonna be Gods, but I do think that to some degree, if you're like an organization, you think you're gonna create, like, this one super intelligence, it does have this feel to me of, like, people trying to create a God. And that's just, I find that both the wrong way to look at it, but just also very unappealing. You know, there's almost  
200 million creators on our platforms. They all are trying to  
build their community. People wanna interact with them. There aren't enough hours in the day. Like, I wanna make it so  
that every single one of them can easily train, like, an  
AI version of themselves that they can, like, they  
can make it what they want. So, it's almost like a  
kind of artistic artifact that they're putting out  
there for their community that allows their community  
to interact with them, but also gives them control over how that interaction happens. And I think that that's gonna be great and there's gonna be millions or, you know, eventually  
hundreds of millions of those. So, let's get into the broader strategy and how this is all going to work. Like, will we have  
AI-generated influencers with AI-generated captions and  
avatars talking to avatars? Like-  
Yeah, I think we'll have all of it. Do you wanna create the first  
AI-generated social network? Well, I think that that  
will be part of this, but, you know, actually one of the most interesting use cases that people have for Meta AI today, it's like in the top four use cases, is role-playing difficult  
social interactions that they're gonna have. So, whether it's in a  
professional context, like, okay, you wanna ask  
your manager for a raise, or, like, I'm having  
this hard conversation with my girlfriend or my friend. Like-  
I could have role-played this conversation with you today. I mean, hopefully it's not- No, it's fine.  
I mean, like, hopefully it's not stressful for you, but-  
It's super fine. But, like, it's a clear social tool where there's no judgment, right? The AI isn't sitting there, there's no, like, social  
repercussion for what you ask it. But what evidence do you have that people wanna live  
in this virtual world and socialize with avatars, or that it's actually good for us? Well, I think that people wanna connect with each other, right? I actually think, like,  
all the other stuff is generally noise. But all the technology  
allows you to do that in a better and better way. When I got started with  
Facebook, it was mostly text. And then this whole, there's been this whole kind of, like, technological evolution where we got smartphones that we could primarily be taking photos and then the mobile networks got good, so then you could be kind of sharing videos and video's a lot richer and consuming video is  
a better experience. I just don't think that's  
the end of the line. I think it gets more immersive. You renamed your company Meta. You're still pouring billions  
of dollars into the Metaverse. Are we as far along as  
you thought we'd be, you know, a few years down the line? Are there any lessons in  
the urgency of the pivot? Well, a lot of the reason why I did that is because I think we were  
getting kind of pigeonholed as just this, like,  
social media app company. The Metaverse thing was always gonna be a  
very long-term thing. I think some things have  
gone better than I thought. Some have gone slower. The glasses I think is  
probably the best example of something that is going better. They're stylish. They're good glasses. It's a great form factor for AI. We didn't know that AI  
was gonna be a thing when we started working on that project, or I mean, we thought  
it was gonna be a thing, like, 10 years from now, but if you asked me five years ago, I would've guessed that  
AR would come before AI, not the other direction. So, some of this is just about  
kind of setting yourselves up to ride the different  
waves when they come in. Sequoia calls AI the  
$600-billion question. There's all this investment in chips and the infrastructure  
and the data centers, but when does it start paying off? Like, is it a bubble? And if not, like, when do  
you start seeing the money? I think bubbles are interesting because a lot of the bubbles  
ended up being things that were very valuable over time and it's just more of  
a question of timing, like you're asking, right? Even the dot-com bubble, you know, it's like  
there's all this fiber laid and it ended up being super valuable, but it just wasn't as valuable  
as quickly as people thought. So, is that gonna happen  
here? I don't know. I mean, it's hard to  
predict what's gonna happen in the next few years. I think AI is gonna be very fundamental. I think that there's a meaningful chance that a lot of the companies  
are overbuilding now and that you look back and you're like, 'Oh, we maybe all spent some number of billions of  
dollars more than we had to.' But on the flip side, I actually think all the  
companies that are investing are making a rational decision because the downside of being behind is that you're out of position for, like, the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years. You said your goal is getting to artificial  
general intelligence? Yeah.  
Or AGI. How do you define AGI, and do you get there first?  
Yeah, no, well, it's a good question. We're basically already  
starting to work on Llama 4 and our goal is to  
completely close the gap with all the others on that. So, I don't know. I mean, do we get to AGI first? I mean, I think that there'll  
probably be some breakthroughs between now and then. It's hard to just predict  
in a straight line. Then you get to the more  
complicated question, which is like, what is it? I don't know that there's, like, one  
specific definition for this, 'cause I think intelligence is, it's multi-variate, right? It's not like there's one number  
that is your intelligence. So, there's probably a specific aspect of intelligence or modality which is like reading  
people's faces and emotions and that's something that I care about. So, I think we'll probably try to build that in at some point. You know, what we're trying to help enable the whole community to do is create all these different AIs for all these things  
that people want to do. And I don't know, that's  
kind of how I think this ends up being a  
good thing for the world. This place is so peaceful. Yeah, I mean, we just  
love being out in nature. Is this like your escape, your  
oasis from the real world, from your virtual world-  
From the real world. And your virtual world? I don't know. I like being in Palo  
Alto and out there too, but it's just kind of nice to spend time up here over the summer and, you know, get the  
kids out on the lake and teach them some different sports and I think that that's all nice. What should kids be studying these days? I think the most important thing is just, like, learning  
how to think critically and learning values when you're young. Now, one of our daughters  
is super creative. I mean, she wrote this outline for a novel that she wanted to write and now it's like 40 pages in and, you know, we sit and, you know, when we hang out with her, we'll use Meta AI to generate the images. Like, it's about mermaid  
crystals is her novel and it's, yeah.  
I know a few kids who would like to read that. Yeah, no, I think it's, you know, it's probably gonna be a banger. I mean, this is somewhat  
of a hiring philosophy that I have too. You know, if people have  
shown that they can go deep and do one thing really well, then they've probably gained experience in, like, the art of learning something and taking it to an excellent level, which is generally pretty  
applicable to other things. You go all in on everything  
you do, it seems like. How do you make time for it all, the sports, the side quest, the super engaged CEO, to being a dad? I actually think having balance between the different things that you do helps make you do all the things better. I think I'm a pretty intense person and- Just kind of. I try to have some mercy  
on the people I work with and not focus too much energy  
on any one project, you know, 'cause, you know, I wanna make sure that people have the flexibility and space to go do their thing. So, yeah, no, I think that  
that's part of, like, being, you know, an interesting  
and well-rounded person and learning, is like you want to have  
different experiences. Got it? Nice, Mark. I know you've always  
been fascinated by China and you learned to speak Mandarin and what do you know about  
where China is on AI and AGI? I don't personally know a ton. There's this question which  
is how should the US approach kind of AI competition with China? And there's one strain  
of thought which is like, 'Okay, well, we need to,  
like, lock it all down.' And I just happen to think  
that that's really wrong because the US thrives  
on just kind of open and decentralized innovation. I mean, that's the way our economy works. That's, like, how we build awesome stuff. But I think the leading companies should work with the US government and make sure that our  
kind of national defense and things like that have sort of a perpetual  
first mover advantage on the leading technology in the world. So, we win the AI wars this way. I think there, there's the question of what can you hope to achieve? If you're trying to say,  
'Okay, should the US try to be five or 10 years ahead of China?' I just don't know if  
that's a reasonable goal. So, I'm not sure if you can maintain that. But what I do think is a reasonable goal is maintaining a perpetual,  
you know, six-month to, you know, eight-month lead by making sure that the American companies and the American folks working on this continue producing the best AI systems. And I think if the US can  
maintain that advantage over time, that's just a very big advantage. There are obviously a lot of players. What do you make of Sam  
Altman's leadership? He deserves a lot of credit for how that organization has developed. Also, having gotten a lot  
of public scrutiny myself, I think it's like, look,  
when you're going through it for the first time, you don't handle it, you know, as perfectly as you would like. But I think he's handling  
it very gracefully. I think he's doing better than I did. And it's a somewhat ironic thing to have an organization  
that's named OpenAI but is sort of the leader in  
building closed AI models. And it's not necessarily bad, but it's kind of a little funny. Facebook and you have been  
blamed for a lot of things. Whether you agree or not, why  
should we trust you with AI? Well, it's a loaded question. We have gotten blamed for a lot of things. And I mean, look, I take our role in all this stuff seriously and I think we've tried to handle all this as well as possible. I'm not sure that it's all been fair, but, like, I'd like to think that we're an important  
and relevant company. So, I think the scrutiny  
is generally healthy. One of the defining  
things around open source is that anyone can scrutinize the work. And because of that, I think  
it just puts a lot of pressure to make sure that the quality of the work that you're doing  
gets better really quickly. I wanna talk about the  
2024 presidential election. Okay. Facebook has been a flashpoint in many elections around the world and you personally have been called out most recently by former President Trump. This is a big election. What do you think is at stake? Well, I mean, look, it's  
obviously a very important and it'll be a historic election. The main thing that I hear from people is that they actually wanna  
see less political content on our services because they come to our  
services to connect with people. So, you know, that's what we're gonna do. We give people control over this, but we're generally trying to recommend less political content. So, I think you're gonna see our services play less of a role in this election than they have in the past. I've done some stuff  
personally in the past. I'm not planning on doing that this time, and that includes, you know, not endorsing either of the candidates. Now, look, I mean, there's obviously a lot of crazy stuff going on in the world. I mean, seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the  
air with the American flag is one of the most badass things  
I've ever seen in my life. But, look, I mean, it's, you know, as, and I think, look, at some  
level, as an American, it's, like, hard to not  
get kind of emotional about that spirit and that fight and I think that's why a  
lot of people like the guy. But I view our role here is to make it so that everyone  
can express their views on this stuff and I think that that's  
probably the best role that we can play. We're facing a crisis in mental health, especially among teenagers. The Surgeon General is now calling for a warning label on social media, saying that it's partially to blame. With everything that you know now, does he have a point? There's clearly an issue with mental health in the country. So, I think that's like  
a really important thing. And for kids and teens,  
it's especially important and I think the focus on that is right. You know, I have three young girls and being a parent is hard and, like, you care, like, you just wanna make sure that they have, like, good lives. And so, like, from that perspective, what I aim for us to do is build our services in a way  
that's aligned with parents, giving them the controls that they need to basically oversee how the  
services work for their kids. What the data says today  
is a little bit different from what the basic meme  
is that's out there. I think a lot of people kind of act as if there's been this proven  
connection between these and I just don't think that the  
science supports that today. It might be that kind of  
phones have an issue, right? If you're getting kind of, if you're getting notified for  
something or it's buzzing you and it's, like, preventing  
you from sleeping. I mean, that is different  
from social media. But, look, I mean,  
there are clearly issues here across society and we want to make sure we're  
part of the solution to that. Mm-hm. You're doing all these things  
to make us more virtual, but you also love so many things about the real world.  
Yeah, yeah. How do you wrestle with  
those two ambitions? Well, I don't know that  
they're at odds. I don't know. There's, like, a bunch of  
people in the tech community who think, like, 'Oh, we'll  
just, like, separate out our consciousness and intelligence and, like, upload it to the cloud,' and I'm like, 'That just  
sounds ridiculous to me.' I mean, to me it's like, like, I think part of  
what makes you a person is you, like, are active  
and you have energy, right? Like, we're not just minds, right? Like, I think the kind of the energy and, like, the love and all those things are, like, probably as foundational to what makes you a person. You're gonna teach me how to wake surf. I heard you're a surfer  
and you're from Hawaii. No, no, no, I'm from Hawaii  
and I have surfed before. Great.  
But I'm not a surfer. Okay.  
I hear you're a surfer. Yeah, Priscilla's quite good. I'm really glad Priscilla's here because I hear she puts you in your place. Yeah. Oh, yeah, a little, a little. Look, it's good. It's good. What's Mark's best dad joke? So, like, sometimes when Mark  
has a fail with the kids, he'll just say like, 'Not my best work. Yeah.  
'Not my best work.' That's just like a thing he says. No, when I'm braiding  
Max's hair every day. You braid hair?  
Yeah, I braid Max's hair and I'm like, 'Oh, you know,' it's like, 'I think I did well tonight,' or it's like, 'Oh, this  
is not my best work.' But now the kids will grade him and go- Yeah, so it's like-  
'Dad, not your best work.' What's it been like for you being in a relationship with  
all of this, like, for so long? I think being in nature and, like, doing sports  
is, like, so important, especially for Mark. Mark has so much energy. He needs to burn off  
energy every single day. How do you keep up? I mean,  
how does anyone keep up? Well, I don't. It's fine. He can do his own thing. Well, Mark's supposed to teach me, so I said that-  
Let's do it. How successful I am depends on how good of a teacher he is.  
Exactly. So, a surf wave, the waves  
come from behind you. This is coming a little bit from the side. So, the force, it kind of  
pushes you in that direction. Okay.  
So, you can lean into the wave more than you  
would on a normal surf. Don't worry about that part. Yeah, it'll actually,  
it'll be pretty easy. Your body will know what to do once you get up. That's our coaching.  
That's our family sports motto. Your body knows what to do.  
Your body knows what to do. All right, I'm ready to rip. Ready to rock.  
Ready, Alohi? Let the board flip. Yeah, oh, she's so close! She'll get there. This is the part when people are like, 'Are you sure this sport is fun?' I mean, she's managing that. She's fine. That's 30 seconds. I mean, Alohi, are you doing  
this differently for her than you are for us?  
Uh, no. Your body knows what to do, Mark. Yeah, my body does know what to do. All right, go for it. Makes it look so easy. Woohoo! Woo! Yeah, there you go. What do I do now? Now point the nose in here. Oh. You've been at this for 20 years. How long do you wanna keep doing this? Like, you have all this. Surfing is fun. Fighting is fun. Building things is really fun. At this point, you know, I kind of think about what I'm building in terms of like, you know, like, in 10 or 15-year chapters. I think, like, AI is  
gonna take 10 or 15 years to fully materialize as will all the work in the next computing  
platforms that we're doing. And then my guess is that  
over that period of time, the next set of things will emerge. With tech in general, bigger picture, it almost seems like we're running this massive experiment on ourselves. Like, how does it all end? I mean, I'm not sure that  
there's, like, an end point. I just think that there's  
a broader arc here. So, you know, I know that  
there's a lot of people who are concerned, like, is AI going to, you  
know, like, prevent us from being creative or things like that? I think it's gonna be the opposite. You know, when I was getting  
started with my company, you know, I needed to know  
all this stuff about coding in order to be able to  
build the idea that I had. And in the future, you  
may not even need to. You might just be able to,  
like, you know, express what you're trying to build and an AI system will be able  
to help you with the code and all of that. Obviously, there's all these challenges that we'll need to navigate along the way. You know, stuff changes and that raises new challenges. But I'm pretty optimistic about  
that kind of grand arc here. So, I have an idea  
about how to protect us. I brought you some sunscreen. This is, like, about the amount  
of sunscreen that I need. So, I appreciate that."
