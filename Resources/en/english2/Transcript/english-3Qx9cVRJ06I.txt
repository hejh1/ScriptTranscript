How would you set the goals for YouTube? Hey everyone, I'm here today to do another product management mock interview with Selena. We're super excited to have you back on the show to do another interview, Selena. But before we jump into it, could you tell us a little bit more about yourself? Absolutely. Nice to meet you viewers. My name is Selena. I'm a product manager at Facebook and actually knows Stephen from back during our time together at Stanford and I also previously did.
a mock interview with Exponent about Facebook movies, which is really popular, Stephen mentioned, so we're happy to be back. - Yeah, your video just reached 100,000 views by the time people are watching this one, it might be much more than that, but we're super excited to be having you back today and at the request a lot of people to talk about an execution type question. These are more analytical, metric-driven questions that are asked by top tier tech companies. And so without further ado, I'll jump into asking you the question.
and there'll be a couple of follow-on questions that we'll do to investigate the issue further. And so first off, we're gonna be talking about YouTube today, which is the platform that we're gonna be showing this video on in an awesome, like, big, high-growth channel right now, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. So the question that I have for you, Selena, is how would you set the goals for YouTube? - Yeah, absolutely. Just give me one second to click on my thoughts. - Take your time.
All right. So I think the way that I'd like to go about this is first we'll talk a little bit about YouTube, YouTube's mission, and what their overarching goals would be in like a high level metric bucket that we would wanna set a success. And then we'll dive into user actions that could best support that overall metrics, so we can hone in a little bit closer on what we'd actually like to track. And then from there, I'll propose some tactical metrics as well as a top line goal metric, and then probably some counter metrics
and then I'll close it up with an evaluation of any trade-offs. Sounds great. Thanks for laying it out. Awesome. Yeah, so YouTube's mission overall, I would say, is to first of all entertain its users, you know, billions of people all over the world love to go to YouTube to watch videos every day. But also to inform, I think a lot of people also use YouTube with that use case to educate themselves and learn something new. So in terms of an overall metric, I think we could
either go for an engagement bucket metric or potentially retention or monetization. So YouTube monetizes with ads and they actually also have a subscription product, a couple subscription products, YouTube premium, YouTube TV. So I think we could consider a monetization as well. But I really think that it's important to focus first on engagement and then monetization will follow. So if you have users who are loving your product, who are coming back to your product spending time in your product.
That's how you're able to monetize and either insert and breaks or upsell people to the subscription product. So I think I would really like to focus on an overall goal of monetization. We'll drill, I mean, sorry, of engagement. And we'll drill into that a little bit further as we go in. That sounds great. That makes sense. Before we jump into that perspective, I'm curious, Slene, if you'd have a perspective on when we wouldn't prioritize it that way, like, would we, is there a case you can imagine where we might prioritize monetization over engagement?
Yeah, I think, you know, YouTube is a mature product. So we could focus on monetization at this stage. I think you just want to be careful to not focus only on monetization and forget why you're building the product in the first place, which is to entertain people. I think once you have a really stable, sturdy base, like definitely you can add teams that really focus on monetizing and really growing your books. But I think, you know, overall engagement is the way to win and you know.
There's competitors encroaching in the space like a Facebook videos, for example, on Facebook watch. So I think engagement is the way to go in this particular case. Totally. Cool. Yeah, go ahead with the engagement and with us to drill into that more. Okay. Awesome. So I think next is thinking about user actions that would help to lead to engagement. So YouTube is all about watching videos. So I would say that's really the number one action that we want to drive is, you know, how many videos
users are watching for day, how long they're staying to watch videos. You could probably also look at the diversity of videos they're watching, or people deep diving into one particular area, or they really, you know, exploring the full variety of content from different content producers as well. So I think that's on the watch time side, and then on the other engagement activities that you can do, I know you can like, you can comment, you can subscribe. So I think those are all really important actions that helps you
the ecosystem because YouTube, it's not just viewers, there's also creators, which is really important for the overall amount of content that's on the platform. So I would want to make sure that there was engagement in terms of users following them and commenting and liking. So I think those are the two buckets that I'm going to start with for now. So we have watch time. Chis, number of videos watched, overall length of session.
And we could also look at the average per user, as well as the overall top line numbers there, and then kind of other engagement actions, which was liking, commenting, subscribing. I'm trying to think are there other actions that I want to highlight?
in terms of engagement. You know, I think you could also consider on the creator side, uploads might be a way to measure engagement. I think I do want to focus on the viewer in this particular case. So I'll probably focus more on there, but I did want to highlight that census is a two-sided market. You'd want to think about the creator side as well. well. But I think the overall, you know, North Star is really about people watching.
watching on YouTube. - Totally.
Okay, so now that we have this like large list of metrics that we could look at, I'm going to prioritize a couple so I'm going to pick some tactical metrics that we would want to, you know, it's more of a gut check to make sure we're on the right track and then a top line metric, which is our overall North star. This is the one we want to be driving to accomplish our overall mission of entertaining and informing people and then I'll also suggest tracking metric for thanks to watch out for to make sure we're not.
you know, running into too many trade-offs along the way. >> Okay, sounds great. >> So I'm just going to take one second. >> Go for it.
Okay. So I have my three categories. I have my tracking metrics. I have my north star metric and I have my counter metrics. So I'll start first with tracking. So this is really what's telling me if this was early on in the launch of the product, that things are going in the right direction. These are early indicators, leading indicators that things are going well. So I would wanna track average watch time per user. And this is letting me know for a given user who's watching how long are they watching.
I would also want to track the average number of videos watched per session. This is giving me a good understanding of the number of videos that are being shown, as well as potentially some distribution across creators. And then the last one is a likes comments, shares, sorry not shares, subscribes per videos viewed. So I'd want to see that's almost like a like through rate kind of blended metrics. I'd want to do a wait to figure out
you know, what particular weight of these leads to users being more likely to come back and retain a week from now and to engage more with videos. And I would want to see a healthy score there. Got it. And on that last one, do you have a hypothesis on what blend or how you'd prioritize or wait some of those likes, comments and shares or subs, I think, yeah. Yeah, I think here I would actually be inclined towards subscribers because I think that's what really powers the ecosystem that then would lead creators to want to upload
more videos. So I think that would be really important, but also this is also a social product, so I would want to make sure that there's still, you know, discussion going on in the threads as well. Got it. Okay, so then this brings me to my North Star, which is really watch time. At the end of the day, that's how, you know, you're going to get your monetization down the line and how you're also going to prove that users are enjoying the content that's there. And this can vary with the length the video so there's different lengths of content on YouTube like this.
video will be a certain length. So I think we'd also want to pay attention to, you know, how watch time is distributed as the length of content varies, right? Because maybe you'd have someone watching one hour video and bailing out and they only watched one video versus people watching a lot. And there's a lot of different content format links that are coming out. So I think that could help to inform the strategy moving forward. Totally. That's something a great North Star metric, like any concerns with it as
we've come to this sort of circling around this metric? Yeah, so I think that's a great transition to my counter metrics. And one of them would be wanting to make sure that people spend time, it's like time well spent. I know that's the Facebook metric, but basically we don't want people spending so much time on YouTube that they forget to live. So I would want to make sure that people are healthy and enjoying the internet in a positive way. I think there's also a distribution concern right if people are just really
have it holding on one particular length, they're not expanding to the full ecosystem of creators. So I'd want to make sure that all the different creators had at least some share of that distribution. And then I guess there's other counter metrics that aren't related to watch time. Do you want to talk more about these inverse of watch time metrics or am I good to cover the other counter metrics? - You can cover the other counter metrics. - Okay, yeah. So the other two that I wanted to watch out for was
So this is all about engagement and retention is not quite the same, but if I was noticing, you know, a drop off in users who weren't coming back to me, this would show me that the quality of the videos we were showing wasn't matching what they expected. So I would be looking out for that and another one I would look out for is the amount of reported videos. So maybe you watch time is up, it's really high, but these videos are low integrity, which is a brand risk. So you want to make sure that, you know, the content is up to a certain standard, especially there's, you know, a lot of kids.
that watch you to, so I want to make sure that our community was a positive and safe place for all of our users to be. Totally, that makes a lot of sense. Any other comments about the metrics and sort of the ones that you've, the counter metrics as well before I ask a hypothetical question about the metrics? Yeah, I think you could maybe also consider the counter metric of creator distribution. I kind of mentioned that as something you don't want to track long watch time, but I could see that also being a counter metric to
look out for if you just saw a really high concentration on specific videos. I know this is also something that YouTube changed the way that videos could go viral, to help ensure kind of more distribution for all different types of videos. So you wouldn't want too much watch time concentrating on any one particular producer or video type. So you might want to track that not just as a more star, but as a counter metric as well. Totally. Okay, awesome. Well, thanks for the thoughtful discussion around watch time. I want to transition this interview into
a different sort of question where we're going to imagine that that key North Star metric that you picked of watch time is unfortunately suffering a 3 to 4 percent decline over the past couple of weeks. And so, you know, weeks to months maybe, let's approximate, but the time age isn't so important as insofar as what I want you to do is to imagine that you're a PM at this team and you know, you've done the thoughtful consideration around watch time. But,
How would you investigate what's going on here or what's causing this decline in that North Star metric? Yeah, absolutely. So I think the most important thing whenever this happens in an interview situation or in real life on the job as a product manager, you want to start by asking questions. You never want to immediately just run off and start diving into the data by yourself. Like make sure that you're asking some key questions about this new trend. So I think the first The first thing I want to ask is how long has this been happening?
Did this happen yesterday? Has this been going on for a week? Maybe a month? Yeah, let's say that it's been happening for weeks to a month. So maybe like four weeks to a month or two ago, like we've seen this decline. So within the range of like two to three months or one to three months or so. Got it. So it sounds like it's been going on for a while. Does that mean it's been a gradual change or was it acute like three months ago? And we were just now getting around to dealing with it. Yeah, we're seeing the grudges.
declined to the state where it is today over the past few months. Got it. Okay, so I think my next question would be, are we seeing this decline across the board in terms of geography or is there a particular geography where we're noticing that the decline? We're seeing that a decline actually mostly in the domestic markets, a United States, we're not seeing that a climb as much in emerging markets or foreign markets.
Got it. That's good to know. Okay, let me think a little bit.
Normally, I would ask, is it just this product or a broader product, but since it's YouTube, that's kind of the whole thing. I guess I could ask, there is YouTube TV and YouTube premium. Is this focused on watch time of a particular segment? That's a great question. It's not focused on a particular segment. So we're seeing this decline kind of across the board on YouTube over the past couple of months. Okay. Bye.
All right, this is going to be my last question before I'll put into buckets my kind of issue triage identification Which is is there a particular device type that this is focused on? Great question. There isn't a device type associated with this decline So the devices seem to be uniform across iPhone Android As well as the different device types within those categories. So like the different iPhones or the different you know Samsung or like pixel phones
Got it. Okay, so at this point, I'm going to pause my general questions and then I'll focus in three different buckets of where I think the issue could be arising. And I like to think about this as internal to my team. So I should probably ask you what team I'm on. An internal to the company and then external are the three general buckets I look into. So I know I'm a YouTube. Is there any particular teams that I'm on? Let's say that you're on the
general YouTube team, you're not on premium or YouTube TV, you're on the YouTube product that people generally see when they come to YouTube.com as a non-paying user. Got it. Okay, so given what I'm hearing that this happened gradually from weeks to months focused in the US and it's happening across the board, this would lead me to think it was either due to something that happened externally, potentially with a competitor or that's something that happened
that has happened over time. That's either due to an experiment or a deprioritization. But since it's gradual, this is telling me that it's a user behavior shift normally more than it would be an infrastructure issue or a system that went down, which would typically demonstrate a more acute sudden decline. So I'll run through a couple of questions. I think first I'll ask the burning question, which is, did our competitors launch something
month period that's drawing share away from our products because that's kind of what I'm feeling is maybe most it play. Yeah, so definitely we've seen a lot of competitive products in this space in the past couple of months and and so there is tough competition and we do know that from just like marketing or partnerships perspective but it's a little unclear to us right now if that's the reason that we're experiencing the decline but that definitely could be something we want to investigate further. Okay, got it.
All right, let me think. Maybe I'm also thinking externally. I know we work with partners and third parties. So is there anything that happened potentially with a partner or someone that we work with that would have gradually caused us to climb? Maybe they were migrating off of, like I know we offer YouTube on TVs, maybe some older TVs no longer support our YouTube app or or something like that that could be causing the issue. Yeah, that's a great question. You know, a lot of, for example, Android.
devices might partner with certain OEMs to make sure certain apps appear there and they could be a case where the YouTube app did not appear on a device partner. But in this case, we're not seeing any changes in partnerships. In fact, the partnership season, let's just say, is in two months. So the renewals of all those contracts would have happened with them and it wouldn't have happened within the past few months. Got it. Um, let's see. So I guess this is my last experience.
question before I go into internal to the company problems. Was there any bad press that happened about our company? Maybe a couple of months ago that would cause users to solely but surely abandon. It's a great question again. I mean, sooner or later, China's self has been testifying in front of the US government. So there could be something there, but for now, for all of the purposes, we're not seeing something so damaging or so shocking that would have caused a huge change in the measures. Got it. Okay.
So now I'll ask some questions that probably were rising from internal to the company issues, but I'm still holding on to that. It could have been something with the competition in the back. >> Come. >> So my second leading theory, second from competition would actually be cannibalization. So did we launch something new that's separate from watch time that would maybe be drawing users slowly away or maybe something we're experimenting with that's being rolled out
that could be impeding watch time. - Yes, so we've actually launched a feature on YouTube where you can see it's kind of like Instagram Reels or TikTok where we've created a lot of like short clips of videos that users can browse through really quickly. - YouTube Sharts, yes, very. Yeah, well, I would say that that would be likely a sense of shorter length content to lead to a decrease in watch time.
3 to 4% seems pretty consistent where I wouldn't expect it to be an enormous sea change, but as users are adopting this product more and more, if that length of video is shorter than the typical YouTube video length, then you would see a corresponding drop in watch time. Like that's not necessarily a bad thing, you know, given all of the engagement, especially among younger audiences with TikTok. This could be a strategic choice and it is a
strategic choice to launch this product. So I wouldn't say that it's necessarily a cause for alarm in the near term, but we should definitely be thinking about, you know, how much watch time are we willing to give up to support this new product launch? And, you know, maybe, maybe watch time isn't the right North Star. Maybe it's, you know, how much enjoyment users are getting out of the videos. And since there's a general trend, shorter videos, maybe, you know, a total max watch time isn't necessarily the best demonstrator of people enjoying this new product.
Totally. And yeah, in this particular case that we're talking about today, we can imagine that YouTube shorts was just launched. And so in that case, the algorithm wasn't quite right, maybe to ensure long-term engagement or longer-term watch time. And so that might have cannibalized some of the YouTube traffic that we normally expect with users watching short-form content that is not as effective at finding the algorithm to get users to continue to watch the experience. which could definitely happen.
when a company launches a new product, but hopefully in the future cases, YouTube wouldn't see that decline as much. - Yeah, absolutely. I think since algorithms learn from user behavior, it's almost expected in the near term if you're moving away from a longer content form to a shorter content form that it's not gonna immediately get it right. - Totally. So congrats to getting the right answer. I know it's stressful and I thought you did a great job kind of discussing a lot of the different criteria. I'm curious also for you, if you were going to just dig any further,
you would have explored how do you had the opportunity to explore some of the other avenues or answers? Yes, so I think a similar side of the coin I would ask, you know, are we deprioritizing our regular product in favor of another one, which is kind of the exact same question, but focusing instead on the relative prioritization of the two products, which I think is absolutely true. Sometimes I look at internal to the team, which I think with a product like YouTube,
less valid, but sometimes you can think, okay, did my particular team launch an experiment that's impacting another team or vice versa. I think here it's easier to think about it as a total platform effect because of the way YouTube does as a product. That's always an area I like to explore as well. - Totally. Well, Selena, you can take off the interview, we had you did an awesome job. I want a deep brief. Yeah, I want a deep brief like how this was for you. And I wrote down some thoughts on what I thought you did so awesome with this interview. And I thought it was a really rich conversation
really educated also so I'm really grateful you were able to do this. But before I jump into my thoughts, did you have any self-reflection or self-feedback on how that went for you? Yeah, I think overall it went really well. I mean, full disclosure, I did intern at YouTube about a year and a half ago now. Feels like forever. So I did have a little bit of familiarity with the company. And yeah, I think the one area that I felt like I could have done a little bit better was defending why not to go for more.
monetization. You know, I think it's always a little bit of a snake chasing its own tail between engagement and monetization, but you can't run a company without having money at the end of the day. So I think that's something that's important to understand when is the right time to focus on that. And I think that's something a lot of companies struggle with. But otherwise, I thought that part was good. I think maybe we're looking for a different trade-off that I didn't mention during the the metric identification so I guess I'll listen to you on that.
that front. And then in the second half around the issue identification, I think there's two kind of flavors for this. Sometimes interviewers are looking for you to identify the case and sometimes they just want to hear how you would talk through that. So I've experienced both in my my interviewing experience and I think, you know, either way you want to just be reasoned with your thinking. And if you don't always get to the right answer, even if that's what they were looking for and you talk through it in a structured way, I think you can still do well.
Totally, it's awesome advice. Yeah, let me run through. I mean, I agree with what you said. Some things that I thought you did really, really effectively, Selena, where one, you did such a great job checking in with me. I feel like it was always on the same page with you throughout that interview. And you even did stuff where you would say, I'm going to move on to this section and you really communicated with me frequently throughout the interview, especially with execution questions, it gets really easy to kind of slip into this pattern where you're going to say, hey, is it this? Is it that? Is it this?
I, as an interviewer, don't really have a sense of what you're thinking or how you're thinking about that problem. And so that's not an effective tool for the interviewer to assess your capabilities. But one line in particular that stood out to me was, you said, "I'm going to keep competition in the back of my head or over here, and I'm going to move on to this section." And I thought it was really effective because you sort of acknowledge the interviewer, "I haven't fully figured that out, and I know it's still an open issue, but I'm going to investigate these other things." And I thought that communication style was really, really valuable. I also thought you did a great job of breaking down.
the problem. So you'd often enumerate or split up the problem space into different components. For example, internal external to the company, external or sorry, internal to the team, internal to the company, or external. That was a really awesome way to break down the problem and to know where your head was throughout each of those steps. So I thought that was really effective as well. I needed to do that a couple times. I think, you know, I may have jumped ahead of you on this one, but mentioning counter metrics beforehand or, you know, You know, making sure you slip those in is really important.
didn't have a specific counter metric that I was looking for. So it's funny that you thought that maybe I was just putting on my tough interviewer face or something. But it was more honestly like the counter metric discussion that I think you did was a really thoughtful one. And if I had more time, I would have asked you more about, you know, like time will spent, what does that look like in that experience? I do agree the monetization angle we could have had maybe a richer conversation around that. But I didn't think that that was so important to the essential interview question that I was asking. It was kind of a side tangent that I took you along.
So honestly, overall, the last thing that I wanted to mention is that you really did a great job of thinking about the goals of the company first. These questions often seem tricky, but they really make a lot of sense when you think about the goals. And so I loved that you thought about the goals first and they kind of boiled it down. So I don't have too much constructive feedback. I thought this was like a really awesome answer. It was a really fun conversation also. And then yeah, maybe one last point that I would say is just that the execution part at the end, being specific about how you identify those issues, so you ask the question.
their competitors, but there might be more specific ways to identify competitive companies in the space. So perhaps you could have asked about, are there other analogous products within Google's ecosystem or partner network that have seen a decline, or maybe are users of YouTube's API seeing a decline, or embedded videos on YouTube seeing a decline that might start to hint if it's a competitive issue or not. So that was just one constructive piece of feedback, but overall really awesome.
some interview. Do you have any thoughts, reactions, comments, or last tips for the viewers? - No, I think that all sounds great. And I think that's a really awesome suggestion to think about other ways to plug into, is this an internal or external issue outside of the core product? So I think API is a great suggestion if that's the type of product you're focusing around to get at that same question from a different angle. - Thanks again, Selena, for being on the show. Thanks, it was really great to see you.
