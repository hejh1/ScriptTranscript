Have you heard the term "Zucka Sons"? Uh...  "Zucka Sons"? Oh, it is. You haven't heard that? It's "Zucks Renaissance". Huh. What is this?  You know, you've got this new look, the chains, the sheerling jacket. Everything you do seems to become a meme. At least make them good memes. Right. Well, it seems like you're leading in on the joke.
- And I think as I've gotten older, I've just like, "All right, whatever, it doesn't matter," right? It's just kind of try to be myself as much as I feel comfortable being.  - Mark Zuckerberg, the face of Facebook, has been under the bright lights for 20 years, on the offensive, buying Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus, and the defensive, battling a never-ending cascade of criticisms about the social, political, and business impacts of his
expanding empire. Lately though, Zuckerberg appears to be reinventing himself and his company. Meta's latest push is a major play to open source AI in contrast to close source competitors like OpenAI and Google. Zuckerberg predicts his company's newest AI models will have a profound impact on the progress of technology, business, and maybe the world. I've come to Meta HQ to get a glimpse of the real Zuck, and the AI future, he believes, is the path forward.
So I found an article in the Harvard Crimson going back to 2003 where you were talking about open source. Okay. Like, over 20 years ago. Really? So you've been thinking about this a really long time? Well, yeah, it's a big part of the tech industry. I mean, you wouldn't have been able to build the early version of Facebook without that. I was a student, I didn't have access to a lot of capital. There's the whole kind of hacker mentality of you. like, and they just take the code.
use it for the thing that you need to. It's more cost efficient. And I mean, that's how you can start something like this in a dorm room. Some people see you as an unlikely champion of open source today. You're laughing. Why, I don't know why. I mean, I actually think, well, I get it. But yeah. You understand the word unlikely. Yeah. We've actually-- it meta have been pretty big proponents of open source for a while. And it's been a really good formula for us. So dating back to how we designed servers.
how we design our data centers. We have this whole open compute project that kind of standardized a lot of the infrastructure for the industry. That's gonna happen with AI too. - You're really putting a stake in the ground by open sourcing your AI in this attempt to build the AI rails for the future. How much of this is a strategic way to control or own the next technology wave? - A lot of how we've grown up over the last 10 or 15 years was building our apps through.
phones, platforms that our competitors controlled. So it's somewhat soul crushing to like go build something that you think is gonna be good, and then just get told by Apple that you can't ship it because they want to like put us in a box because they view us as competitive. You know, we're a big enough company now that one of the things that I've resolved is that for the next generation of technology, I want us to build and have more control over the next set of platforms that we're gonna build. So I think AI is a critical one, And I think augmented inverse.
virtual reality as another critical one. It's kind of the way that we can control our own destiny on this and make sure that we have access to leading AI is by building it and having it become an industry standard, but actually gets stronger by being able to share it and have the ecosystem around it. - You're continuing to improve meta AI across all of your products, but also as a standalone chatbot. Why should we use meta over chat GPT? - Well, there's a bunch of things where it's better. one of the things that we're rolling out.
soon is the ability to just like imagine stuff. You're typing something in real time. I do this with my daughters all the time. And as you're kind of typing and entering the query, it's just generating the images as you enter the key strokes. It's just really cool. My goal for the Met AI launch, which I mean, it's only really few months old at this point, was to, by the end of the year, have Met AI be the most used AI assistant in the world.
I think we're basically on track for that. I mean, there's hundreds of millions of people who-- By the end of this year. Yeah, and I think we're going to be there before the end of the year. So you're releasing Lama 3.1, this family of models, big and small, including the biggest open source model ever, 405 billion parameters. What does that jump unlock? I actually think the main thing that people are going to do, especially because it's open source, is to use it as a teacher to train smaller models that they use in different applications. And if you just think about like all the startups out there or all the enterprises, or even government
that are trying to do different things, they probably all need to at some level build custom models for what they're doing. And it's really hard to do that with closed systems out there, whether that's open AI or Gemini, Google's thing, or whatever. And this is like, gets to a pretty core part of our philosophy is we don't believe there's going to be like one AI to rule the mall. Our vision is that there's going to be millions, or just billions of different models out there. So not one God but many. Is that the way to think about it?
But I do think that to some degree, if you're like an organization, you think you're going to create this one super intelligence that does have this feel to me of like, people trying to create a God. And that's just, I find that both the wrong way to look at it, but just also very unappealing. You know, there's almost 200 million creators on our platforms. They all are trying to build their community. People want to interact with them. There aren't enough hours in the day. Like, I want to make it so that every single one of them can easily train
version of themselves that they can make it what they want. So it's almost like a kind of artistic artifact that they're putting out there for their community that allows their community to interact with them, but also gives them control over how that interaction happens. And I think that's going to be great. And there's going to be millions, or eventually hundreds of millions of those. So let's get into the broader strategy and how this is all going to work. Like will we have AI generated influencers with AI generated
and avatars talking to avatars. - Yeah, I think we'll have all of it. - Do you want to create the first AI-generated social network? - Well, I think that that will be part of this. But, you know, actually one of the most interesting use cases that people have for Met AI today, it's like in the top four use cases, is role-playing difficult social interactions that they're gonna have. So whether it's in a professional context, like, okay, you wanna ask your manager for a raise or like, I'm having this hard conversation with my girlfriend or my friend. I could have roleplay this come
- I mean, hopefully it's not stressful for you, but it's super-- - But it's a clear social tool where there's no judgment. Right, the AI isn't sitting there. There's no social repercussion for what you ask it. - But what evidence do you have that people want to live in this virtual world and socialize with avatars? Or that it's actually good for us? - Well, I think that people want to connect with each other. Right, I actually think like all the other stuff is generally noise. But all the technology allows you to do that.
and a better and better way. But when I got started with Facebook, it was mostly text. And then this whole, there's been this whole kind of like technological evolution where we got smartphones that we could primarily be taking photos and then the mobile network's got good so then you could be kind of sharing video and videos a lot richer and consuming videos a better experience. I just don't think that's the end of the line. I think it gets more immersive. - You renamed your company Meta. You're still pouring billions of dollars in your Metaverse. Are we as far along as
Do you thought we'd be a few years down the line? Are there any lessons in the urgency of the pivot? - Well, a lot of the reason why I did that is because I think we were getting kind of pigeonholed as just this like social media app company. I mean, the metaverse thing was always gonna be a very long-term thing. I think some things have gone better than I thought. Some have gone slower. The glasses I think is probably the best example something that is going better.
They're stylish, they're good glasses. It's a great form factor for AI. We didn't know that AI was going to be a thing when we started working on that project. Or, I mean, we thought it was going to be a thing like 10 years from now. But if you asked me five years ago, I would have guessed that AR would come before AI, not the other direction. So some of this is just about kind of setting yourselves up to ride the different waves when they come in. Sequoia calls AI the $600 billion question. There's all this investment in chips and the infrastructure and the data centers. But when does it start paying off?
Is it a bubble? - Wow. - And if not, like, when do you start seeing the money? - Um... I think bubbles are interesting, because a lot of the bubbles ended up being... things that were very valuable over time, and it's just more of a question of timing, like you're asking. Or even the .com bubble, you know, it's like, there's all this fiber-laid and it ended up being super valuable, but it just wasn't as valuable as quickly as people thought. So, is that gonna happen here? I don't know. I mean, it's hard to predict
I think AI is going to be very fundamental. I think that there's a meaningful chance that a lot of the companies are overbuilding now and that you look back and you're like, oh, we maybe all spent some number of billions of dollars more than we had to. But on the flip side, I actually think all the companies that are investing are making a rational decision. Because the downside of being behind is that you're out of position for the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years. You said your goal is getting to artificial general intelligence. Yes. Or AGI.
find AGI, and do you get their first? - Well, it's a good question. We're basically already starting to work on Lama 4, and our goal is to completely close the gap with all the others on that. So, I don't know, I'm gonna do we get to AGI first, and I think that there will probably be some breakthroughs between now and then, it's hard to just predict in a straight line. Then you get to the more complicated question, which is like, what is it? I don't know that there's like one specific definition for this.
intelligence is multi, it's multi-variant, right? It's not like there's one number that is your intelligence. So there's probably a specific aspect of intelligence or modality, which is like reading people's faces and emotions. And that's something that I care about. So I think we'll probably try to build that in at some point. You know, what we're trying to help enable the whole community to do is create all these different AIs for all these things that people want to do. And I know that's kind of how I think the sense of being a good thing for the world.
This place is so peaceful. - Yeah, I mean, it's, um, we're just loving out in nature. - Is this like you're escape, you're oasis from the real world, from your virtual world? - That's a real world. - And your virtual world. - I don't know. I like being in Palo Alto and out there too. But it's just kind of nice to spend time up here over the summer and get the kids out in the lake and teach them some different sports and I think that that's all nice. What should kids be studying?
these days. Um, I think the most important thing is just like learning how to think critically and learning values when you're young. Now one of our daughters is super creative. I mean she wrote this outline and for a novel that she wanted to write and now it's like 40 pages in and you know we sit and when I'm hanging out with her we'll use Meta AI to generate the images. Like it's about mermaid crystals. It's just her novel. And it's- I know a few kids who would like to read that. I think it's, it's pretty good.
going to be a banger. I mean this is somewhat of a hiring philosophy that I have to. It's, you know, if people have shown that they can go deep and do one thing really well, then they've probably gained experience in like the art of learning something and taking it to an excellent level, which is generally pretty applicable to other things. You go all in on everything you do, it seems like, how do you make time for it all, the sports, the side quests, the super-engaged CEO, the being a dad? I actually think it having a...
balance between the different things that you do helps make you do all the things better. I think a pretty intense person. Just kind of. I try to have some mercy on the people I work with and not focus too much energy on any one project, you know, because you want to make sure that people have the flexibility and space to go do their thing. So yeah, no, I think that that's part of like being an interesting and well-rounded person and learning is like you want to have different experiences.
- I want to come and kick high, vision.  - I know you've always been fascinated by China and you learn to speak Mandarin and what do you know about where China is on AI and AGI? Um...
I don't personally know a ton. There's this question, which is, how should the US approach AI competition with China? And there's one strain of thought, which is like, OK, well, we need to lock it all down. And I just happen to think that that's really wrong, because the US thrives on just open and decentralized innovation. That's the way our economy works. That's how we build awesome stuff. But I think the leading companies should work with the US government and make sure that you're not in the right place.
sure that that are kind of national defense and things like that have sort of a perpetual first mover advantage on the leading technology in the world. So we win the AI wars this way. I think there's the question of what can you hope to achieve? If you're trying to say, okay, should the US try to be five or ten years ahead of China, I just don't know if that's a reasonable goal. So I'm not sure if you can maintain that. But what I do think is a reasonable goal is maintaining a perpetual six-month
month to, you know, eight-month lead by making sure that the American company is in the American folks working on this continue producing the best AI systems. And I think that the U.S. can maintain that advantage over time. That's just a very big advantage. There are obviously a lot of players. What do you make of Sam Altman's leadership? He deserves a lot of credit for how that organization has developed. having gotten a lot of public scrutiny myself.
I think it's like, look, when you're going through it for the first time, you don't handle it as perfectly as you would like, but I think he's handling it very gracefully. I think he's doing better than I did. And it's somewhat ironic thing to have an organization that's named OpenAI, but is sort of the leader in building closed AI models. And it's not necessarily bad, but it's kind of a little funny. Facebook and you have been blamed for a lot of things. Whether you agree or not, why should we trust you with AI? Well, it's a loaded question.
Um, we have gotten blamed for a lot of things. And I mean, look, I take our role in all this stuff seriously, and I think we've tried to handle all this as well as possible. I'm not sure that it's all been fair, but like, I'd like to think that we're an important and relevant company, so I think the scrutiny is generally healthy. One of the defining things around open source is that anyone can scrutinize the work. And because of that, I think it just puts a lot of pressure to make sure that the quality of the work that you're doing gets better really quickly. I want to talk about the 2024 presidential election.
-Okay. -Facebook has been a flashpoint in many elections around the world, and you personally have been called out, most recently, by former President Trump. This is a big election. What do you think is at stake? -Well, I mean, look, it's obviously a very important and it'll be a historic election. The main thing that I hear from people is that they actually want to see less political content on our services, because they come to our services
is to connect with people. So that's what we're going to do, where we give people control over this, but we're generally trying to recommend less political content. So I think you're going to see our services play less of a role in this election than they have in the past. I've done some stuff personally in the past. I'm not planning on doing that this time. And that includes not endorsing either of the candidates. Now, look, there's obviously a lot of crazy stuff going on in the world. seeing Donald Trump get up after getting sh*t.
shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most bad-ass things I've ever seen in my life. But look, I mean, it's as-- and I think look, it's some level as an American. It's hard to not get emotional about that spirit in that fight. And I think that that's why a lot of people like the guy. But if you are role here is to
make it said everyone can express their views on this stuff. And I think that that's probably the best role that we can play. - We're facing a crisis in mental health, especially on teenagers. The surgeon general is now calling for a warning label on social media, saying that it's partially to blame. With everything that you know now, does he have a point? - There's clearly an issue with mental health in the country. So I think that's a really important thing. and for kids and teens, it's especially important.
important and I think the focus on that is right. You know, I have three young girls and being a parent is hard and like you care, like you just want to make sure that they have like good lives and so like from that perspective what I aim for us to do is build our services in a way that's aligned with parents giving them the controls that they need to basically oversee how the services work for their
for their kids. What the data says today is a little bit different from what the basic meme is that's out there. I think a lot of people kind of act as if there's been this proven connection between these and I just don't think that the science supports that today. It might be that kind of phones have an issue or if you're getting notified for something or it's buzzing you and it's like preventing you from sleeping, I mean that is different from from social media. But look, Look, I mean, there are clearly issues here across society, and we want to make sure we're part of this solution.
- Mm-hmm. You're doing all these things to make us more virtual, but you also love so many things about the real world. - Yeah. - How do you wrestle with those two ambitions? - Well, I don't know that they're at odds. I don't know, there's like a bunch of people in the tech community who think like, oh, we'll just like separate out our consciousness and intelligence and like upload it to the cloud and I'm like, that just sounds ridiculous to me. I mean, to me, it's like, like I think part of what makes you a person is you like are active and you have energy, right? It's not like we're not just minds, right? But I think the...
kind of the energy and like the love and all those things are like probably as foundational to what makes you a person.  You're gonna teach me how to wake surf. I heard your surfer in your whole life. No, no, no. I'm from Hawaii and I have surfed before. Great. But I'm not a surfer. Okay. I hear you're a surfer. Yeah, for sure it's quite good.  I'm really glad for still is here because I hear she puts you in your place.
Yeah, yeah, a little. Look, it's good. It's good. What's Mark's best dad joke? So like sometimes when Mark has a fail with the kids, he'll just say like, not my best work. Not my best work. That's just like a thing he says. No, when I'm braiding, Vax is hair. Every day. Yeah, I braid Vax is hair. And I'm like, oh, you know, that's a guy. I think I did well tonight. Or it's like, oh, this is not my best work. But now the kids will braid him and go, yeah, so it's like your best work. What's it been like for you being in a relationship with all of this?
- I think being in nature and doing sports is so important, especially for Marcus so much energy. He needs to burn off energy every single day. - How do you keep up? I mean, how does anyone keep up? - Why don't? It's fine, he can do his own thing. - Well, Marcus opposed to teach me, so I said that. - That's right. - Yeah. - How successful I am depends on how good of a teacher he is. the surf wave the waves come from behind.
- This is coming a little bit from the side. So the force it kind of pushes you in that direction. So you can lean into the wave more than you would on the normal surface. - I don't worry about that fight. - Yeah, it'll actually, it'll be great. - Your body would want to do once you get out. - That's our family sports motto. Your body knows what to do. - All right, I'm ready to rip. Ready to rock, ready to loathe. Let the board flip. Yeah, get out, she's so close.
- Basically part of what people are like, are you sure this sport is fun? - I'm just asking that. - I'm just asking that. - It's not just you.  - I'm gonna look at you. - I'm just wondering. - Are you trying to stick for me? - For her than you are for us. - Oh, no.  - Oh, look at her. - Oh, my gosh. - Your body knows what to do, Mars. - Yeah. - My body does know what to do. - Alright, go for it.  So easy.
There you go. - Go, go, go. - That was point to go, he's in here.  Oh, yes, sir.  - You've been at this for 20 years.
to keep doing this. You have all this. - Serving this fun, fighting is fun. Building things is really fun. At this point, I kind of think about what I'm building in terms of like a 10 or 15 year chapters. I think like AI is gonna take 10 or 15 years to fully materialize as well the work in the next computing platforms that we're doing. And then my guess is that over that period of time, the next set of things will emerge. - With tech in general, bigger picture. It almost seems like we're running this mess.
of experiment on ourselves. Like, how does it all end? - I'm not sure that there's like an end point. I just think that there's a broader arc here. So, you know, I know that there's a lot of people who are concerned like, is AI going to, you know, like prevent us from being creative or things like that. I think it's gonna be the opposite. You know, when I was getting started with, with my company, it's, you know, I needed to know all the stuff about coding in order to be able to build the idea that I had. and in the future you may not even need to.
You might just be able to express what you're trying to build and the AI system will be able to help you with the code and then all of that. Obviously, there's all these challenges that we'll need to navigate along the way, stuff changes and that raises new challenges. But I'm pretty optimistic about that kind of grand arc here.  So I have an idea about how to protect us. I brought you some sunscreen.
This is like about the amount of sunscreen that I need. So, um, so I appreciate that.
