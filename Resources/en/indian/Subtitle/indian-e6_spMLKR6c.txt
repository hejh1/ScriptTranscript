Thank you for that presentation. And please don't call me ma'am. I'm your age, I think. How old is everybody here? Maximum, I just turned 23, so we're the same age. Thank you so much for having me. I'm very, very happy to be here addressing this crowd. I consider you all my friends because we are the same age. 

I don't know where to start. So, I'm a student myself; I just finished my graduation. All I want to say is that this life that you're living right now, your college life, is your most important period. You should really, really focus on your college life because what I did is I missed out on my college years because I was very busy practicing kickboxing, karate, and mixed martial arts. I had no time. My college was two hours away from where I used to live. I am not really from proper Bombay; I am from this place called Kalyan, which is sort of on the outskirts of Bombay. So I used to travel two hours for my college, but I had no time because I had to focus more on my sports—that was my first priority always. So I missed out on my college days. I did not go for college festivals. I did not have a group of friends. You know, all these groupies, homies? I didn't have any homies. I was alone, and I had only one best friend, and that's it. That's my college life, and I really, really feel sad that I missed out on it. But then I focused on sports, and that is how everything happened. That is how my life changed.

If you have something in life that you really, really like, if you have a special talent, or if your heart is into something else, I will not say to completely neglect studies. Do not ever neglect studies. I'm a graduate, okay? Don't neglect studies, but focus on what you're really, really good at and make that your strong point because that's what I did as well. I also believe that in life, no matter what you do every day, give your 100% because you never know what's coming for you. You never know what the next step is, right? I don't know how Irudhi Suttru came to me. Madhu Sir saw me fighting; I wasn't even aware that he was looking at me. I just gave my best shot, and he's like, "Who's this girl? She's good." And I'm like, "Okay, I'm doing a film." I was very happy. So that's how it happened for me.

When Irudhi Suttru started, I didn't even know Tamil. I don't even speak Tamil. It was a very new thing for me to do acting. I've never done it before. I've never even talked to people and faced cameras. So, that's why I look really bad sometimes in pictures—I'm always like... Because I don't know; the camera is on me, and I get really awkward. So I just give my 100%, that's it. That's all I do.

What else do I have to say? Yeah, do not fall for bad things. I know at our age, 22, 23, 21, we get attracted to things that are sort of negative, towards negative people who try to be very smart and play with us. I've been played many times. Yeah, I've been a lot, but I'm learning. I still am played with every day, but I learn from my experiences; that's what's the most important thing in life. Learn from your mistakes. Don't just let mistakes happen, and then, you know, they'll happen again because you're not learning, so learn! 

And you know what? Don't do drugs. Please don't do drugs or alcohol. Can you believe this? I'm such a nice kid. I've never touched alcohol. I've never touched a cigarette in my entire life, and drugs—NEVER. Thank you. Thank you. I've never done it because I had something that was very important in my life, and that was my sports. As a sportsperson, if I do all that, I lose my career. What else? Yeah, work out! Work out every day. Go for a run, go for a jog, whatever—work out. Because I think that your body is your best accessory. You don't need earrings, jackets, or clothes if you have a hard body, right? 

So I'm so sorry. Oh, my God. Just, you know, exercise because your body is your best accessory. Make sure you work on it every day, eat good food. I also love junk food; I'm a huge McDonald's fan, but sometimes I have to control that. Not because I'm in films, not because I'm an actress, but because I'm a human and my body supports me every day of my life. I've been living happily for 23 years, okay? Because my body has supported me so well. So it's your time to give something back to your body; your body deserves it. 

Okay, so eat well, work out, and stay focused. Don't fall for bad things because you never know what life will throw at you next. Maybe something very good, something very big and huge and positive, is waiting for you, but you don't see it, and you get demotivated by signals not working for you. Don't let that happen. Stay positive, always.
