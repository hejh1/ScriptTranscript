As a kid, how you work? There was a spark in your eyes. Do you see the spark now?
Are only sparks of anger, sparks of misery. I feel like telling them, pulling their cheek and
pulling their ears and, "Hey, come on, laugh, smile. Life is so short to enjoy, to be happy here.
Why are we so miserable holding on to the past? Past is anyway gone, right? If you can see the entire
past as a dream, as a movie that's gone, something happens within you. You become aware inside.
You have to simply blow the past for a minute and come to the moment. Life springs up.
Even in life, there are for good times, bad times. Who did not have bad time? Who did not have good
time? Tell me. Everybody did some good time bad time. Look back and see. Didn't you have
difficult time, five years back, three years back, ten years back? Yes. But you still survive? You
will survive this also? You'll move on. Looking at your own experience, your own life, you'll get
the confidence to wake up. It gives you the confidence, "Hey, I can do it." Second, invoke
the valour inside of you. Come what may I will manage? I'll see. I have the energy, the strength,
the power, the trust in the energy, the power that you have is the second option. Third is, you know,
anyway, everything will go one day. Whether you are successful, you will die. Whether your failure,
you will not die. Success or failure, everybody is going to die. Everything is going to finish.
The curtain is going to come down on the play. However, the play was, whether it is tragedy, comedy,
however it was. Just be a witness to your own life and its events. That can keep your smile
and your life force alive. And the fourth thing is, though that you are not alone,
there is a high of power which is so kind, so compassionate, and it's holding your hands.
It has done it in the past. So, Billy, whatever you call it, God, you call it the higher self,
or you call just the consciousness, whatever you call it, but there is a power. That's all.
You know, all that you want to know, you cannot know. You cannot know about love.
You can only feel it. You cannot know about joy that only you can experience it. Every
mature scientist says, "What I know is very little. What I don't know is huge."
And any philosopher you ask will say, "Well, I don't know."
So, life is a journey from an ugly, "I don't know," to a beautiful, "I don't know."
See that? When you are angry, what do you say? "I don't know." When you are frustrated,
you come up with say, "I don't know." But that journey has to move from a frustrated,
"I don't know," to a beautiful, "I don't know." And all that is worth in life,
you cannot understand them. Love, you cannot understand. I can talk to you two hours about love,
but the little dog in your home will convey to you in 30 seconds. You can only see through
eyes, not through your ears. You cannot taste through your nose. Similarly, love can only be
felt in the sixth sense, nor through side touch taste, smell and sound. You know, when tsunami
happened, nobody gave warning. But all the animals, they left the seashore three hours before,
they climbed, they went up the hill. So, no animal was lost, but human beings were lost.
Because animals sometimes use their sixth sense. We do have, but we don't use. Because
we are so caught up in a day to day thing, you know. We are all the time thinking, thinking,
thinking, thinking. And we don't let the sixth sense come up inside of you.
Today, earlier, I was told, you know, there is a recent research which says,
the more screen time you spend, the less creative you become. Because when you are looking at the
screen, you don't blink. And if you don't blink your eyes, you become less creative.
And then you can explore within this body of ours, there is tremendous potential.
Your intuitive ability can make your life so much more easier, better. What do you need in life?
Intusion, intelligence, innovative space. Big creative. All these three comes
when we do some meditation. And that is why meditation is so important. It just help us to
get our mind free from all the shackles we put around the mind. See, meditation is an effortless
process. Usually we think, oh, we have to concentrate, concentrate, concentrate. No.
Whatever thoughts come, let it come. Then you start relaxing, relaxing.
Then you reach a space deep within you. Spend a little more time and meditate. You will
explore a different dimension in your own universe, in your own life.
Fear, love and hatred, they form a triangle. When there is love, there is no fear. When there
is fear, then there is no love. When there is hatred, there is no love nor fear.
What can help you to get over fear, is your breath, Ujjayi breath, breathing from the back of the throat.
That will help you to step in life. I would like you to make one resolution. What? Drop all your
worries here. You go back with a big smile and spread smiles all around. Yeah? This is needed today,
right?
