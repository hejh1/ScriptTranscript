"Situations are happening around us. Not all situations will ever happen the way we want them to because a situation is not just about me; a situation involves so many people and so many forces. All of them need not happen my way, but if I'm happening my way, I'm blissful.

Okay, now coming to intention. You know, like you say that your thought is something that, when you give it out to the universe, like the Law of Attraction—the ask—I'm reading all these American books. I've read Inner Engineering as well, but it just makes me curious about these things. When you say the Law of Attraction, where you ask, believe, and receive, anything that is sent out to the universe in a positive direction or in a constant direction rather happens, you know? Because they say that you design your destiny; you design your life. Like you just happen to say that, your conscious efforts can have control over your life.

Now, coming to intentions: what if someone is sending out a positive signal? Great. What if someone does not agree with it? You made a theory. There are lots of "ifs." Okay, so my question is, if someone is sending out—okay, you want your life to be a certain way—you send out positive signals, which is great, but to whom? To the universe. In which direction? Down? That's what I'm asking. How does the Law of Attraction work? Does it really work? It doesn't work? So what works? 

The Law of Attraction is something that happens between opposites, yes? Whether it's two magnets or, you know, two opposites—male and female, or whichever way. The Law of Attraction is always between opposites, isn't it? From North Pole to South Pole, it's working like that. Right now, you're talking about the universe, so that means you are an alien to this universe. If you're part of the universe, what is there to be attracted about? Well, why do they say then you can design your own destiny? You can determine your destiny; you should. That's what being human means, right?

See, if you had come here like any other creature on this planet, they have compulsive cycles. They live by that. It's okay for them because that's all they're capable of. Once you have come as a human being, everything that you can do—actually, if you look at your life, you're not doing anything very greatly different from what the other creatures are doing. They are born; you are born. You grow up; they grow up. They reproduce; you reproduce. They die; you die. Nothing very different. 

But these same simple things we can conduct consciously—that is the significant thing about being human. The moment you conduct it—let's say you conduct your hand consciously—now this hand will do what you want, isn't it? You won't simply sit here and do like this. Now this hand will do what you want. Suppose you conduct your thought consciously; now your thought will do what you want. If your thought was doing what you want, how would you keep yourself blissful or miserable? Blissful. 

Yeah, if you're blissful, would you go in search of happiness? So these things that people think are the greatest things in their life—to be peaceful, joyful—nonsense wouldn't mean a thing to you because you're blissful. But you can't say that to them; they'll feel insulted. You have to play the part. But essentially, if your thought and emotion were taking instructions from you, you would keep yourself in the highest level of pleasantness, whatever that is, isn't it? Correct? 

Yes, if that happens, your entire life process will come to ease—total ease. Right now, this is because you’re a crouching tiger; you have to go get something always. There is nothing to get. If you sit here, your life is complete—nothing. Now, it's at ease—total ease. When it's in this kind of ease, it will become perceptive. 

Now, just pursuing a profession, making money, or even being joyful or being loving or falling in love—nothing means anything to you because just sitting here, the highest level of pleasantness is happening to you. So what would you do with that life? Naturally, you would explore something that is not in your perception. 

Right now, this is how the spiritual process begins; this is how you take charge of your life. Now you wish for something; it happens. I want you to know this: for most people, at least 50% of what they wish happens. It is just that they are focusing on a few things that did not happen. If you want to be fair in a reasonably well-settled society, 90% of what they wish happens. It’s the 10% they’re complaining about, yeah? Hello, isn’t it? So 90% of your life is happening the way you want it; the 10% you're cribbing. You're never enjoying the 90% because this 10% did not happen the way you wanted. 

Yeah, so already, to a large extent, you are in control of your destiny. A little is going off, but that little can bother you. It's like you drove 100 km properly. Let’s say you have to drive 100 km. 90 km, you went properly where you wanted to go. At the 91st kilometre, you crashed. Still, it’s not good, isn’t it? So that's why they’re complaining. I'm not saying they're complaining for nothing because 90 km, everything went well. Just before reaching, something crashed, so they still suffer for that. 

Now, right now, this is because situations are happening around us. Not all situations will ever happen the way we want them to because a situation is not just about me; a situation involves so many people and so many forces. All of them need not happen my way, but if I'm happening my way, I'm blissful. Okay, whether the golf ball flies straight or goes into the mountains, I'm still blissful. As long as you're playing golf— even if I'm not playing, right?

So now, coming to this: as long as things happen your way and you're on your own, and you're blissful, and you know—no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not saying as long as things happen your way, you will be blissful. If you're blissful, it doesn't matter which way it happens. Right? Whichever way it happens, you're blissful. 

Right? See, this is essentially the world has put the cart before the horse. You tell me: is it easier to take charge of yourself, or is it easier to take charge of all these people? I mean, it's tougher to take charge of yourself, you know? You can take charge of these people, right? Because people—no, no, no. Why I'm saying that is because people don't realize that they need to take charge of themselves and are out there to take charge of societies and communities and people, trying to change others.

Right now, you're sitting here. Is it easier to take charge of yourself or take charge of all these people? Myself. Yourself. You must first do that. 

Now, what is simple and easy? If you take charge of yourself, let us see how much we can get cooperation from these people. Now, when you say you're in pursuit of happiness, what this means is you want all of them to function the way you want. Then you will be happy. 

Now, when we say, "If this happens, I will be happy. If that happens, I will be happy," what it means is the world should function; the universe should respond your way. That’s not what I’m saying. No, I don’t believe in that because that’s trying to put conditionality into everything. You know, this is how it should function according to me.

What I was saying was that, say, okay, for example, a very basic example: somebody wants to be an actor, or somebody wants to be a cricketer. And I'm taking a very basic example of what you want to do in life. And you, let’s say, it did not happen. It did not happen. It means why? What, people did not like your acting, or the selectors did not like your cricket? Something happened. So what you wanted did not happen. 

Can you still sit here blissfully? That’s a question not a lot of people can answer. That is why I'm saying what you're trying to do is, when you say everybody should like what I'm doing, in some way you have to take charge of their minds. That's what you're doing—in some way through your cinema or whatever, you’re taking charge of their mind and doing what appeals to them, and that's why it's working, isn't it? Otherwise, it won't be working, right? 

So which is easier: taking charge of this or taking charge of that? This. If you take charge of this, now you are not in pursuit of your happiness. You are not tense about anything. There is no sword hanging over your head. You will do everything to the fullest, to the hilt, because you don't care what happens. Whatever happens, you’ll be still fine. This much you know. Now you will naturally do everything wonderfully well because there’s absolutely no concern. You’re not a vested interest anymore. You will do what is needed without any effort. 

So what somebody thinks is a great circus and a feat, you will do it joyfully, playfully.
