The lines will be so blurry that it will not matter where it comes from. It is only the content that will matter. They will not be South actors, North actors. It will all be about Indian cinema growing and I am telling you, we as Indian entertainment industry are going to be a very huge or probably one of, probably the biggest players in the next decade. Good afternoon everybody. Thank you. I'd like to thank the entire media for being here.
taking this event to the hearts of the people. Thank you very much. And it's an absolute delight to address to the national media for the first time in my life. It's a great moment for me. Thank you. Thank you very much. And I am pretty positive that I will keep seeing you a lot more in the future. Thank you. - That's so nice of you, sir. That's so nice of you. A brilliant human being, a wonderful dancer, brilliant actor. So what is that one thing that you see in a movie before signing a movie? What is that one? Thank you.
The intention and what you're doing the film for. Are you doing for the money? Are you doing it for the release? Are you doing it for the audience? The intention is above all. Unfortunately, because of the unfortunate circumstances, this took a lot of time. Absolutely. What work did you have to say on that? It's a very difficult film to shoot. We were shooting this film in a forest and we were a crew of almost 500 people. and the logistics to provide 500 people.
food, accommodation, sanitation, all this was very very difficult in a remote forest area. So it is a very difficult to shoot a film to shoot especially during the Covid times it's so many Covid restrictions. I think I would always I said it earlier also this one pushpuff film was equal to four films effort. First of all I'd like to thank the audience all over the north for receiving South Philips and making it so big.
Not just about watching South Films in the North, we equally admire Bollywood. In this cinema, we've always been admiring it for years, for many, many years. We also invite in this cinema to talk into our languages and come and we will be there to support your films also. It is not about South cinema or North cinema. It's about Indian cinema. I think we all will grow together as the biggest cinema in the world in the years to come
Thank you. This is the first time, in spite of your movies working so well on satellite, working so well online, theoretically, this is the first time you're pan-India film coming. So henceforth, like you have icon releasing, there is icon and there's probably a Corrata La Seva movie also. Henceforth is every allewalting movie going to be a pan-India film. I mean, there is no doubt about it. There's no option. Preferably, I'd like to make it everything pan-India because not just about pan-India, I'm I'm saying why are you even districting to that?
You know, maybe somebody else wants to watch it. You know, people in other countries, maybe Sri Lanka, neighboring countries, Pakistan. Other countries want to watch it. We don't know, you know, languages no barrier for cinema. So I think we should just go for, I would say more than pan India. I would say we should go for a multi-language release and see how far we can go as Indian cinema. - Hi, hello. You look so pretty and beautiful. Yet you portrayed the character. It is a reglam character. So did you have any in habit?
inhibitions? No. I think I had no inhibitions when it came to I knew I was playing a different character. I knew that I had to pull my heart, soul, sweat, everything into this character because this is like I keep saying this is a whole different world that we're entering. And when you know actors like sirs doing such hard work and you know I'm getting this opportunity to you know.
work with sir. I can't have inhibitions and be like, "Oh my God, do I look pretty, do I look bad, do I look this... I have to worry about the performance." I'm like, "Am I... am I doing a good job? Am I doing that? Is it coming through? Is this character staying strong? What is happening?" So for me it was all about performance in this film and I think once the the audience see it on the 17th, I think it will come through and
please give us your reviews. Aloo Arjun. And, ma'am, to second that I'd like to speak about how to make up a form then what is it? I truly appreciate Rashmi Rajeev, performing like this and taking up such a challenging role. It is a little rustic role and it's not a very conventional glamorous role. It is quite challenging and like you said, I was fearing if which she feel that she's not looking good because that is a very beautiful
factor that plays on the mind and if your mind is not clear, the performance will not be clear. But then after she landed on the set and she worked, she started working, I think she had the mindset that this film is this and we have to justify this film and she did a wonderful performance and I couldn't have performed if not for help, her help because every artist should compliment you for your performance. She performed so well, it was very, very comforting and it was very complementing to work with such a wonderful artist. Tomorrow I am sure you all will appreciate it.
performance. She can't speak for herself but I can definitely speak for her because I've seen her perform part of my eyes. And the song that we just witnessed, you know, you performed exactly like a stone man guy, you know, yet you looked so sexy. Thank you. So, really, sir? Yeah, of course. And I was just going to ask you, I was after that I'll ask you, I mean, you You look so handsome and... - Look so handsome by the way. - Look so handsome by the way.
Why don't you do a romantic role also? But previous film was a romantic role. Okay, coming back to the song, I was asked, the gestures that you did, you know, reminded me of so much of Rajani's that small, small nuances. So will there be a comparison with the Thalaiva? Ma'am, more than comparison, I'll say, it's more of an influence because there's born part of him Chennai. So obviously, I have a lot of subconscious absorption
superstars like Rajani sir, like Kamal sir, you know, that's why if you see him very perform. If you notice that then I you know then I came to Hyderabad, Mr. Tudunjagar was my own uncle, you know when I see him he dances really well and there are his nuances. So I think you know subconsciously when you were, there's a child when you grow up seeing these people, you absorb them and they're subconsciously in your mind, not that I very consciously want to do it. If it came across like that also I don't have an issue and
maybe it's a tribute for them in a way, my respect for them in a way. - Today, Vicky Pedia says, Aaloo Arjun is an Indian actor who primarily works in a particular industry or Rashmi Kamandana is an Indian actress who primarily works. I think there is an insane amount of respect and appreciation for all kinds of films. I have seen that, you know, from the time I've been here, I've seen that we have welcomed all kinds of movies
about us. I'm talking about the Indian audience. I speak to you. There's a friend who's an RJ in Punjab who told me that, listen, please tell them that we are excited to watch the movie. I have a nine year old niece who told me when Citi Ma released that, you know, it's allu versus salu. I said, how did you know? So these are things when you say that you, am I really, people do really, people love me that much. There is an incident amount of love, maybe which you will get to see with this film. I want to look do you see the changing?
shifts in the industries and the respect that is given to each other. Let us speak for now. Hi, both of you. I think there is an extreme, as in in the last decade, I think we've seen such a shift in cinema in our field. I've just entered the industry in four years, but I've seen so much happening before I entered and when I'm a part of Indian cinema now and I can't be proud
I couldn't have entered a better time. I think this is the perfect time that I'm in the industry because I see, like you said, the languages are merging together, we're having pan and dear releases. It's going to be, like so said, Indian films rather than South India film or a volupt film. It's not going to do that anymore in a couple of years. I think it's just going to be Indian cinema. probably we're going to globally globally you know
our film in their languages. So we just need to see the reach. I think we should always experiment with that. But I think it's fascinating and it's super, it's amazing to see all people just appreciate content. Now people just want good content. You know, people want good filmmaking and when you give it people appreciate it and they make it their own. It's a very wonderful question that you asked by the way.
You should see cinema, how it's running, how the trends have been running in the last 10 years, like I'm saying, in the 2000s, you know, it's a very clear back between the South cinema and North cinema, you know, let's be honest about it. And then if you see the entire 2010s, you know, the, the bitches, you know, there's been beautiful bridges, thanks to people like Manishji, you know, who have, uh, bridge of those gaps. Uh, and now everybody's getting familiar with each other's cinema and I'm telling you,
next decade onwards from the 2020s. The lines will be so blurry that it will not matter where it comes from. It is only the content that will matter. They will not be South actors, North actors. It will all be about Indian cinema growing and I am telling you with wonderful platforms that have opened like OTTs. There are so many set of new film makers, directors, actors, technicians. You know this has opened up amazing horizons for us in entertainment industry and we as Indian entertainment industry.
not just cinema, we as Indian entertainment industry are going to be a very huge or probably one of probably the biggest players in the next decade. And I'm very positive as a country we will go up. But you know, in one of your earlier interviews you had mentioned that Hindi film in your filmography is very important. Sorry, can you be a little out? You had mentioned earlier that a Hindi film in your mind.
filmography is very important for you. Has there been offers that you have considered or probably now like you said you know the lines are blurring do you want to do a pure Bollywood film? Absolutely I love in this cinema. You know somehow I sometimes I even I use the word but I don't like to use that word Bollywood as much as possible because you know it sounds like second two Hollywood and how am I kissing a company?
So I like to say Hindi cinema. So in my habit, you sometimes you and I say Bollywood, but I keep going as like, "No, say Hindi cinema. Hum, we see, say, come, name." Coming back to your question, I love Hindi cinema. I love Hindi music. I appreciate them so much. Like, definitely it will be a great moment in my life to do a straight Hindi film. and it will be a landmark point of my career and I want to be a
making, I want to make the best choice possible and to just answer what you said, they have been people who ask for films here and there but nothing very excited, nothing very exciting. So I think slowly, you know, we're being having soft talks like if we can do something, how is it to mount up something big because even the people who are coming, they are also saying that when we have to come to you, we have to come with something solid. So I think once everything falls into place.
I think we will try to plan with maybe little help of Alvar Amgaro if he helps. Just joking. I think we will try to come up with something big and you know make it memorable. Thank you. Thank you so much my dear Rashmika. It was a pleasure working with you. You know everybody calls a national crush. You know I've heard of people calling on national crush. Simply, Qtli teaser on stage has like, "Oh please come crush mika."
Thank you so much and I hope you all like and we all I'm hoping that we touch your hearts with Pushpa.
