>> So, first of all, thank you very much for having me here. At the Inspire Series, it's worked dramatically. I'm already inspired to be addressing this really august intellectual gathering of people from Harvard, a place that my mother thought I will never reach. But you know what?
A lot of people have spoken before me and eloquently and described their dreams for India and given figures and facts that either are skeptical and like Mr. Olber says, aspirational. But I'm just an actor and I'm gonna just give you my dream shamelessly because that's the thing that I can do best. And by that I mean, when we talk of dreams, we have one of our greatest scientists and philanthropist Dr. Abdul Kalam
which is very interesting. He said, "Dreams are not what you have when you sleep." The true dreams are the ones that don't let you sleep.  He said, "When you have that dream once, it's a dream when you have it twice, it becomes a desire." And when you see it for the third time, consequently, it becomes a passion in aim and a goal. And that is the passion with which I want to see this fantasy that I have for India 2030. Abraham Lincoln also.
was a dreamer. And, you know, but he said, one thing that makes most sense in trying to achieve this goal that I have dreamt for my nation. He said, "If I have six hours to cut down a tree, then I will spend the first four hours sharpening the axe." This is a great philosophy in that. In this era of instant gratification, we just keep thinking, we can achieve all these goals by just speaking this, treating that it's not true. I really believe that a missionary zeal is recorded.
to make that quantum change, that can make 2030 what I'm dreaming about right now. And just let's look at India as a country, what a unique nation, seriously. Thousands of years old of culture and tradition, many, many invasions has been ruled for many years, and we still somehow managed to maintain our identity. We still somehow have managed to maintain our Indian-ness, our beliefs of faith. of faith and you know yeah there has been
And we have our drawbacks. There is corruption, there is violence, there is differences between the different religions and sects and caste and everything. But I can't help but think, looking at India at the geography, that we're not doing really that bad. Look at all the other nations around in the world. Look at our neighbours. Compared to that, there is somebody in India who's doing something right for us to be called a growing economy and being
projected as the third largest economy in 2026 and the most educated and young nation in the world, and it still functional democracy. So let's first accept the fact that there is somebody, some people in India with the right ideas and the ability to lead the nation to where we are today. Under that assumption, we are also very capable of finding very unique solutions to the problems that generally the world faces. And one.
None of them, of course, is the fact that we found freedom through non-violence and non-cooperation. Who would have thought that was possible? We have some other grip. No, seriously. I mean, it was as radical a thought then as it is today. And one man in a line cloth with belief in faith and complete conviction was able to do that for us. You know, Mahatma Gandhi. And it's an amazing country of people like Mahavir, Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi and
who also had a dream. He drank then 85 years ago that I dream of an India where no infant cries for the wanton milk. No youngster is deprived of relevant education and no youth goes door to door finding a job. Sadly, it's still a dream today. And I dream of a 2031 this dream becomes irrelevant. I dream of a 2031 everybody so equally satisfied with the dream.
with what they're doing that they're able to actually devote more time back to art and culture, which is another great important aspect of our country. Now, we need to be a, for that to happen, we need to be a healthy nation. And when I say healthy, I remember preparing for a film of mine, which I released recently, where I had to look like a boxer, and I had this, you know, biceps and triceps that had to be there. So I decided just to work on the parts that is seen outside my clothes. So I was just working out on my biceps and my triceps.
I said I'm not shoulders but you know what I suddenly realized? The strengths that I had in my arms and my arms was not actually enough to form it look even fit because it is disproportionate growth. It is the kind of growth that will not make you fit or stung but actually make you look inadequate. And that is what is happening to India today. Everybody says we are the largest economy, the most populated country in the years to come and you know with economic superpower and supremacy in Russia.
rocket and space technology which I'm previewed to and then IT giants and smarter cities. But ladies and gentlemen, I really believe that more than smarter cities we require smart villages. And this is going to be primarily what I talk about today. You know, a nation is only as strong as its weakest link and rural India is our weakest link. See, it's important that growth and progress
goes hand in hand with villages also getting under the same train towards economic freedom, super power, all the terms that have been coined for a successful country. But that is not happening. The reason being we are beginning to ignore them. We're beginning to actually believe that this is a very interesting line that I've found where they say that everybody believes that they know what is required
forgetting the underprivileged and the poor up to stayed with the rest of the country. Okay? And we always start assuming that this is what they want. This is how we can help the poor and the villages and this is what they need. And we can't be more wrong because when you assume and as the spelling goes, you make an ask of you and me. I'm going to tell you how that happened to a friend of mine. His name was, he's a very profound doctor, a gastro-entologist and he got a call from his patient,
who said, "Dr. Sabh, my wife is really, really ill and she's got a big stomach ache and she can't sit and she can't sleep and she's in big pain, can I come and visit you?" And he said, "Yeah, by all means." And like all patients today, he has done his research, he's gone into the internet and he said, "Uscor, yeh, usak, tabo, usak." And the doctor said, "No worry, let me handle it." And he checked her out and he said, "She has infected appendix, so I have to do a surgery and she'll be fine." The surgery was done, he was fine and Abdul was a happy man.
One year later, he calls back the doctor and says, "Sir, my wife has got a stomachache. Please do the appendix operation. She'll be fine." So, doctor said, Dr. Manoj said, "Listen, I am the doctor. Let me diagnose. Please bring her to the clinic and we'll fix it up." This is a big fix up operation date. We'll do it in half a hour and we'll be back. She needs the appendix removed. So, now he is losing his patience, he says let me do the diagnosis.
don't bring her to the clinic and he's still insisting and finally the doctor lost it and he said, "Listen, I am the doctor and let me tell you that every human being has only one appendix and I've already taken out the appendix so please don't tell me how to do my job." Abdul waited very patiently for the doctor to finish with his assumptions and then he's shot back very neatly. He said, "Sir, I agree with you. Every human being can have one appendix but a man can have two wife's right.
So when we start assuming what the rural India needs, we do what I think is most dangerous. In my vast experiences of shooting in really rural India's, you know, and villages and small cookgramms like they call it in Tamil, really small places, I realized shockingly that the biggest financial burden for a person of this particular village.
Would you all be able to guess what is biggest financial burden is? Five minutes? Hey, so I'm going to speak for twenty today. I'm going to reduce the number of questions. I'm prepared. Is that okay? Okay, so can you all tell me anybody? Quick answer is anybody know which is the biggest financial burden for a man in one of these small villages? Sorry? Teft? Health? Okay. No, not health, not the marriage of a daughter, not education, not sorry? Lick on her.
Thank you for reminding me, no. Say it again. Dauri, no. No. No. No. Oh, let me put you on a good misery. No, I'm saying what does the need financial assistance for? The answer is the untimely death of a relative of a senior in their family. That is the one occasion he can't prepare for. That is one occasion where the ceremony diminishes.
He demands that he spend a certain amount of money, fee the certain amount of people, use the expenditure and that's where he takes the loan and that's where he gets indebted. And that's where to escape that particular embarrassment and humility of not having the ability to perform the function every year as expected of the Indian tradition that he decides to leave the village because he's made to feel inadequate. Lord Mikhil had in 1735 had spoken the British Parliament and said the
The only way to rule India is to make the men there feel inadequate. He said, and truly so, that unless he feels that what he has is lesser than what others have, you'll not be able to rule him. And within a very short period, they proved themselves right. The rural India today is feeling inadequate. They're feeling like they're not even part of our country. And what happens with that is, they start then looking at opportunities and villages
better health, better lifestyle and no humility for not having performed the funeral properly, they decide to give up who they are and move to the cities and who they are is what is more important for us to understand. Who they are are actually the timekeepers and the bookkeepers of our deep rooted traditional culture and stories. You know, you should see how tradition and culture flourishes in a happy village in India.
psychiatrist as a big fashion thing in India and they still manage to maintain a great level of sanity. You know there's a great phrase from the poem "if" by Rudyard Kimpling where it says, "Dream but not make dreams, your master think but not make thoughts or aim. Meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same." It's very easy to say it but how do you treat those two imposters just the same? They answer lies in the tradition and the culture and the world.
books and the epics that are so prominent and predominant in our country, the Bhagavad-gita, the Quran, the interpretation of that in the subcontinent, the Bible, the Guru Gran Sahib, the granny stories, and you know how to handle the diversities and the setbacks, and you're able to sit back, assemble, reassemble yourself, come back and fight with the same glory again. And we don't give them, when you don't give a villager that, you're depriving him, we're depriving ourselves of what I think is one of the most important.
survival tool in today's world, which is the culture and tradition. So I dream of a 2030 where rural India has developed as the rest of the world, as aspirational as the rest of India, where the villager is provided with the same opportunities as it is available in the cities. And after a hard day's work, a villager is actually able to come back, sit down, have a drink, put his feet up and start thinking about art and culture and poetry. that would be a dream that I have for 2030, a practical dream that I have for 2030.
And the dreams that your parents and my parents had when we were in college, urban middle class, where everything rolled around the boy, studying hard, getting into a technical college of a repute, and then getting into reputed management's college and finally the green card. And if it was the girl, then it was a spouse with the green card. I dream of a 2030.
where students the world over will dream of a blue card Will dream of having once actually come come to India and study and invite the knowledge that we have as a nation It used to be true. We were the first university in the world Nalanda was a university where people came in from far and wide So it's not a it's not a pipe dream. It is it's a practical dream that I have and I think that's easily easily attainable and finally before I wind up. I think
A dream of a 2030 where we have a meritocratic electoral base which selects its leaders and whose leaders believe that it's more important to serve with the missionary zeal to serve the nation rather than rule it. You know, there is another stanza from the same poem which says that if they have the ability to talk to the crowds yet keep your virtue, walk with kings nor lose the common touch. If neither good friends nor force can hurt you yet all men count with you.
but none too much. If only the politicians understood the gist of that line, we would have a progressive country by 2030, where we will all be proud of not just the way the country's running, but also about our politicians. And finally, I'm an actor. And the dream that I have for myself is that in 2030 I'm as relevant. I'm as handsome hopefully, but if age was to catch up, then they probably would have mapped my face by then
used technology to make me look as young or old as a role desired me to look and I'm still able to romance the pretty young things that will be part of the industry in 2030.  I see that's got many guys going. And finally as an actor I'm used and prone to dialogues. I love to speak dialogues and I suddenly and recently found a line that blew me apart and I thought it was a normal Hindi film dialogue. Where this great gentleman.
have said that whatever I am today and all the achievements that have been that has been possible by me and what will eventually also be possible by me in the near future all because of my angel mother. You know who said that? You know who said that? Shockingly Abraham Lincoln. So I dream of a 2030 where every Indian says the exact same thing about his mother and not
not just about his mother, but also about his motherland. And also, for the sake of prosperity, what is mother-in-law? But hey, ladies and gentlemen, what do I know? I am an actor. Thank you very much for your patience hearing and...
