 Hello, may I see your passport please?
 Here you go.
 Thank you.
 And where are you flying with us today?
 I'm going to London.
 I'll be studying there for a year.
 How fun! That sounds like a great trip.
 I see your information right here.
 Are you checking any bags today?
 Yes, just one.
 Perfect.
 If you could place it on the scale for me that would be great.
 Hmm, it appears your bag is just a bit too heavy.
 It is over our weight requirement.
 Perhaps you could take something out of your bag and put it in your carry-on bag?
 Yes! I'll take this big book out of the bag.
 No problem.
 [ beÄŸen, tusk]
 Great! Now your bag is ready to be checked.
 And I see you've chosen a window seat,
 is that still okay for you?
 - I think so.
 I've never flown before, so I thought it would be nice to look out at the clouds.
 Do you think it will be a good seat for me?
 This is your first flight!
 Well, that's fantastic.
 You're going to love it.
 And yes, I think the window seat is an excellent choice for you then.
 Let me print your boarding pass and you'll be ready to go.
 Okay.
 Here it is, you're all set.
 Thanks.
 You're going to depart from Terminal C, Gate 54.
 When do I need to be there?
 You should get to your gate about one hour before departure.
 And how do I get to the gate?
 You will turn left at the coffee shop.
 Security will be directly in front of you.
 Once you're finished clearing security, follow the signs to Gate 54.
 It will be on your right.
 Thank you so much for your help.
 You're very welcome.
 Enjoy your flight.
 Passport and boarding pass please.
 Thank you. You can go on through.
 Sir, you need to remove your coat.
 And your belt.
 My coat and my belt?
 Yes and your shoes.
 My shoes too?
 Yes please.
 You can place them in this bin.
 You need to empty your pockets and put those items in the bin as well.
 Do you have any liquids in your bag?
 I do.
 I have a water bottle and some hand lotion. You'll need to take those out.
 The water bottle is too big. You can either drink it right now or throw it away.
 I'll just throw it out.
 The hand lotion is fine because it is in a small container. You need to put it in a plastic bag though.
 Do you have a bag that I could use?
 I have never flown before, and I didn't bring one.
 Sure, we have extra bags right here.
 Thank you. Do you have a laptop in your bag?
 I do. I'll need you to remove it as well and place it in a bin.
 Please put your bag on the conveyor belt.
 Now, please step through the scanner.
 What's wrong?
 Please step to the side.
 Stretch out your arms.
 I'm going to scan your body.
 Are you wearing any jewelry?
 Oh yeah, I think my necklace triggered the alarm. Sorry about that.
 Alright, you're all clear.
 You can pick up your items from the scanner.
 and you can head to your gate.
 Have a great flight!
 Thanks!
 United Airlines Flight 803 to London is now boarding.

 Excuse me, miss? Yes!
 My window shade is broken.
 and I cannot open it to see out the window.
 Would it be possible to switch seats so I can have a window with a view?
 This is my first flight and I want to be able to see everything.
 Of course, let's move you to row 38 Seat B.
 You'll be able to see out from that window.

 I'll have coffee with cream, please.

 That would be great. What do you have?
 We have a turkey sandwich, a chicken salad, or a vegetarian pasta.
 Hmm, I think I'll have the turkey sandwich. Thank you.
 Excuse me, can you please tell me where I pick up my bag?
 I checked one bag on my flight here.
 Yes, what was your flight number?
 I was on flight 803.
 I see it looks like your bag will be arriving on Carousel four.
